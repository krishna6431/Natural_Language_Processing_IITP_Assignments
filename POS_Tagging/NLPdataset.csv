A form of asbestos once used to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 30 years ago researchers reported,"DT,NN,IN,NN,RB,VBN,TO,VB,NNP,NN,NNS,VBZ,VBN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NN,NNS,IN,DT,NN,IN,NNS,VBN,TO,PRP,RBR,IN,CD,NNS,IN,NNS,VBD"
The asbestos fiber crocidolite is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later researchers said,"DT,NN,NN,NN,VBZ,RB,JJ,IN,PRP,VBZ,DT,NNS,IN,RB,JJ,NNS,TO,PRP,VBG,NNS,WDT,VBP,RP,NNS,JJ,NNS,VBD"
Lorillard Inc the unit of New Yorkbased Loews Corp that makes Kent cigarettes stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956,"NNP,NNP,DT,NN,IN,JJ,JJ,NNP,NNP,WDT,VBZ,NNP,NNS,VBD,VBG,NN,IN,PRP$,NN,NN,NNS,IN,CD"
Although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago the latest results appear in today's New England Journal of Medicine a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem,"IN,JJ,NNS,VBD,VBN,RBR,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,JJS,NNS,VBP,IN,NN,NNP,NNP,NNP,IN,NNP,DT,NN,JJ,TO,VB,JJ,NN,TO,DT,NN"
A Lorillard spokewoman said This is an old story,"DT,NNP,NN,VBD,DT,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN"
We're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties,"PRP,VBG,IN,NNS,IN,IN,NN,VBD,IN,NN,VBG,DT,JJ,NNS"
There is no asbestos in our products now,"EX,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,PRP$,NNS,RB"
Neither Lorillard nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes,"DT,NNP,CC,DT,NNS,WP,VBD,DT,NNS,VBD,JJ,IN,DT,NN,IN,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,NNS"
We have no useful information on whether users are at risk said James A Talcott of Boston's DanaFarber Cancer Institute,"PRP,VBP,DT,JJ,NN,IN,IN,NNS,VBP,IN,NN,VBD,NNP,NNP,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP"
Dr Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University,"NNP,NNP,VBD,DT,NN,IN,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,CC,DT,JJ,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP"
The Lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in very modest amounts in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of filter in 1956,"DT,NNP,NN,VBD,NN,VBD,VBN,IN,RB,JJ,NNS,IN,VBG,NN,IN,DT,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,CD,CC,VBN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NN,IN,CD"
From 1953 to 1955 98 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold the company said,"IN,CD,TO,CD,CD,CD,NNP,NNS,IN,DT,NNS,VBD,VBN,DT,NN,VBD"
Among 33 men who worked closely with the substance 28 have died  more than three times the expected number,"IN,CD,NNS,WP,VBD,RB,IN,DT,NN,CD,VBP,VBN,CC,JJ,IN,CD,NNS,DT,VBN,NN"
Four of the five surviving workers have asbestosrelated diseases including three with recently diagnosed cancer,"CD,IN,DT,CD,VBG,NNS,VBP,JJ,NNS,VBG,CD,IN,RB,VBN,NN"
The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected the researchers said,"DT,NN,IN,CD,NNS,IN,JJ,NN,NN,NN,CC,NN,VBD,RB,JJR,IN,VBN,DT,NNS,VBD"
The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestosrelated diseases said Dr Talcott,"DT,NN,NN,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,IN,PRP,WP,VBP,JJ,NNS,VBD,NNP,NNP"
The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton Mass paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in Western industrialized countries he said,"DT,NN,IN,NN,NN,NNS,IN,DT,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,NN,NN,VBZ,TO,VB,DT,JJS,IN,DT,NN,NNS,VBN,IN,JJ,VBN,NNS,PRP,VBD"
The plant which is owned by Hollingsworth & Vose Co was under contract with Lorillard to make the cigarette filters,"DT,NN,WDT,VBZ,VBN,IN,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP,VBD,IN,NN,IN,NN,TO,VB,DT,NN,NNS"
The finding probably will support those who argue that the US should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos chrysotile found in most schools and other buildings Dr Talcott said,"DT,NN,RB,MD,VB,DT,WP,VBP,IN,DT,NNP,MD,VB,DT,NN,IN,NN,VBG,NN,RBR,RB,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NN,NN,VBN,IN,JJS,NNS,CC,JJ,NNS,NNP,NNP,VBD"
The US is one of the few industrialized nations that doesn't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth needlelike fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles according to Brooke T Mossman a professor of pathlogy at the University of Vermont College of Medicine,"DT,NNP,VBZ,CD,IN,DT,JJ,VBN,NNS,WDT,VBZ,VB,DT,JJR,NN,IN,NN,IN,DT,JJ,JJ,NNS,JJ,IN,NN,WDT,VBP,VBN,IN,NNS,VBG,TO,NNP,NNP,NNP,DT,NN,IN,NN,IN,DT,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,IN,NNP"
More common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body Dr Mossman explained,"RBR,JJ,NN,NNS,VBP,JJ,CC,VBP,RBR,RB,VBN,IN,DT,NN,NNP,NNP,VBD"
In July the Environmental Protection Agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos,"IN,NNP,DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBD,DT,JJ,NN,IN,RB,DT,NNS,IN,NN"
By 1997 almost all remaining uses of cancercausing asbestos will be outlawed,"IN,CD,RB,DT,VBG,NNS,IN,JJ,NN,MD,VB,VBN"
About 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the Kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s,"IN,CD,NNS,IN,DT,NN,WDT,VBD,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NNS,VBD,VBN,TO,NN,IN,DT,CD"
Areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used,"NNS,IN,DT,NN,VBD,RB,JJ,WRB,DT,NN,VBD,VBN"
Workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters,"NNS,VBD,JJ,NN,NNS,IN,DT,VBN,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,VBD,RP,NN,CC,NN,NNS,CC,RB,VBD,DT,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NN,VBN,TO,VB,NNS"
Workers described clouds of blue dust that hung over parts of the factory even though exhaust fans ventilated the area,"NNS,VBD,NNS,IN,JJ,NN,WDT,VBD,IN,NNS,IN,DT,NN,RB,IN,NN,NNS,VBD,DT,NN"
There's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestosrelated diseases said Darrell Phillips vice president of human resources for Hollingsworth & Vose,"EX,DT,NN,IN,DT,IN,DT,NNS,CC,NNS,VBD,JJ,NNS,VBD,NNP,NNP,NN,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,NNP,CC,NNP"
But you have to recognize that these events took place 35 years ago,"CC,PRP,VBP,TO,VB,IN,DT,NNS,VBD,NN,CD,NNS,IN"

Yields on moneymarket mutual funds continued to slide amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates,"NNS,IN,JJ,JJ,NNS,VBD,TO,VB,IN,NNS,IN,NN,NNS,VBP,JJ,NNS,IN,NN,NNS"
The average sevenday compound yield of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC's Money Fund Report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 845 from 847 for the week ended Tuesday,"DT,JJ,JJ,NN,NN,IN,DT,CD,JJ,NNS,VBN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBD,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,TO,CD,IN,CD,IN,DT,NN,VBD,NNP"
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for a year,"NN,NNS,VBP,NN,IN,NNS,CC,IN,DT,JJ,NN,VBZ,IN,DT,NN"
Average maturity of the funds' investments lengthened by a day to 41 days the longest since early August according to Donoghue's,"JJ,NN,IN,DT,NNS,NNS,VBD,IN,DT,NN,TO,CD,NNS,DT,JJS,IN,JJ,NNP,VBG,TO,NNP"
Longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period,"JJR,NNS,VBP,VBN,TO,VB,VBG,NN,NNS,IN,PRP,VBP,NN,NNS,TO,VB,RB,JJR,NNS,IN,DT,JJR,NN"
Shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner,"JJR,NNS,VBP,VBN,DT,NN,IN,VBG,NNS,IN,NN,NNS,MD,VB,JJR,NNS,RB"
The average maturity for funds open only to institutions considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely reached a high point for the year  33 days,"DT,JJ,NN,IN,NNS,JJ,RB,TO,NNS,VBN,IN,DT,TO,VB,DT,JJR,NN,IN,DT,NNS,VBP,DT,NN,RB,VBD,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,CC,CD,NNS"
Nevertheless said Brenda Malizia Negus editor of Money Fund Report yields may blip up again before they blip down because of recent rises in shortterm interest rates,"RB,VBD,NNP,NNP,NNP,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNS,MD,VB,RP,RB,IN,PRP,VBP,RP,IN,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,JJ,NN,NNS"

Typically moneyfund yields beat comparable shortterm investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates,"RB,NN,NNS,VBP,JJ,JJ,NNS,IN,NN,NNS,MD,VB,NNS,CC,VB,IN,DT,JJS,NNS"

The move leaves United Illuminating Co and Northeast Utilities as the remaining outside bidders for PS of New Hampshire which also has proposed an internal reorganization plan in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings under which it would remain an independent company,"DT,NN,VBZ,NNP,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP,IN,DT,VBG,JJ,NNS,IN,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,WDT,RB,VBZ,VBN,DT,JJ,NN,NN,IN,NN,CD,NN,NNS,IN,WDT,PRP,MD,VB,DT,JJ,NN"
New England Electric based in Westborough Mass had offered 2 billion to acquire PS of New Hampshire well below the 229 billion value United Illuminating places on its bid and the 225 billion Northeast says its bid is worth,"NNP,NNP,NNP,VBN,IN,NNP,NNP,VBD,VBN,CD,CD,TO,VB,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,RB,IN,DT,CD,CD,NN,NNP,NNP,NNS,IN,PRP$,NN,CC,DT,CD,CD,NNP,VBZ,PRP$,NN,VBZ,IN"

John Rowe president and chief executive officer of New England Electric said the company's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to PS of New Hampshire  such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating efficiencies  didn't come true,"NNP,NNP,NN,CC,JJ,JJ,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBD,DT,NN,NN,IN,NN,MD,VB,IN,PRP,VBD,DT,JJR,NN,CC,PRP$,NNS,VBN,TO,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,JJ,IN,NN,IN,NN,NN,CC,VBN,NN,NNS,CC,VBD,VB,JJ"

The fact that New England proposed lower rate increases  48 over seven years against around 55 boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders  complicated negotiations with state officials Mr Ross asserted,"DT,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,VBD,JJR,NN,NNS,CC,CD,IN,CD,NNS,IN,IN,CD,NNS,VBN,IN,DT,JJ,CD,JJ,NNS,CC,IN,NNS,IN,NN,NNS,NNP,NNP,VBD"

The refund pool  may not be held hostage through another round of appeals Judge Curry said,"DT,NN,NN,CC,MD,RB,VB,VBN,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,NNS,NNP,NNP,VBD"

Commonwealth Edison said the ruling could force it to slash its 1989 earnings by 155 a share,"NNP,NNP,VBD,DT,NN,MD,VB,PRP,TO,VB,PRP$,CD,NNS,IN,CD,DT,NN"
For 1988 Commonwealth Edison reported earnings of 7375 million or 301 a share,"IN,CD,NNP,NNP,VBD,NNS,IN,CD,CD,CC,CD,DT,NN"

The 25 billion Byron 1 plant near Rockford Ill was completed in 1985,"DT,CD,CD,NNP,CD,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,VBD,VBN,IN,CD"
In a disputed 1985 ruling the Commerce Commission said Commonwealth Edison could raise its electricity rates by 49 million to pay for the plant,"IN,DT,VBN,CD,NN,DT,NNP,NNP,VBD,NNP,NNP,MD,VB,PRP$,NN,NNS,IN,CD,CD,TO,VB,IN,DT,NN"

The Illinois Supreme Court ordered the commission to audit Commonwealth Edison's construction expenses and refund any unreasonable expenses,"DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBD,DT,NN,TO,VB,NNP,NNP,NN,NNS,CC,VB,DT,JJ,NNS"
The utility has been collecting for the plant's construction cost from its 31 million customers subject to a refund since 1986,"DT,NN,VBZ,VBN,VBG,IN,DT,NN,NN,NN,IN,PRP$,CD,CD,NNS,JJ,TO,DT,NN,IN,CD"
In August the commission ruled that between 190 million and 195 million of the plant's construction cost was unreasonable and should be refunded plus interest,"IN,NNP,DT,NN,VBD,IN,IN,CD,CD,CC,CD,CD,IN,DT,NN,NN,NN,VBD,JJ,CC,MD,VB,VBN,CC,NN"
In his ruling Judge Curry added an additional 55 million to the commission's calculations,"IN,PRP$,NN,NNP,NNP,VBD,DT,JJ,CD,CD,TO,DT,NN,NNS"

The survival of spinoff Cray Computer Corp as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily on the creativity  and longevity  of its chairman and chief designer Seymour Cray,"DT,NN,IN,NN,NNP,NNP,NNP,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,VBZ,TO,VB,RB,IN,DT,NN,CC,CC,NN,CC,IN,PRP$,NN,CC,NN,NN,NNP,NNP"

Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that Cray Research Inc will withdraw the almost 100 million in financing it is providing the new firm if Mr Cray leaves or if the productdesign project he heads is scrapped,"NNS,VBN,IN,DT,NNPS,CC,NNP,NNP,IN,DT,VBG,NN,VBD,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,MD,VB,DT,RB,CD,CD,IN,NN,PRP,VBZ,VBG,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,VBZ,CC,IN,DT,JJ,NN,PRP,VBZ,VBZ,VBN"
The documents also said that although the 64yearold Mr Cray has been working on the project for more than six years the Cray3 machine is at least another year away from a fully operational prototype,"DT,NNS,RB,VBD,IN,IN,DT,JJ,NNP,NNP,VBZ,VBN,VBG,IN,DT,NN,IN,RBR,IN,CD,NNS,DT,NNP,NN,VBZ,IN,JJS,DT,NN,RB,IN,DT,RB,JJ,NN"
Moreover there have been no orders for the Cray3 so far though the company says it is talking with several prospects,"JJR,EX,VBP,VBN,DT,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,RB,RB,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,PRP,VBZ,VBG,IN,JJ,NNS"
While many of the risks were anticipated when Minneapolisbased Cray Research first announced the spinoff in May the strings it attached to the financing hadn't been made public until yesterday,"IN,JJ,IN,DT,NNS,VBD,VBN,WRB,JJ,NNP,NNP,RB,VBD,DT,NN,IN,NNP,DT,NNS,PRP,VBD,TO,DT,NN,VBD,VBN,VBN,JJ,IN,NN"
We didn't have much of a choice Cray Computer's chief financial officer Gregory Barnum said in an interview,"PRP,VBD,VB,RB,IN,DT,NN,NNP,NNP,NN,JJ,NN,NNP,NNP,VBD,IN,DT,NN"
The theory is that Seymour is the chief designer of the Cray3 and without him it could not be completed,"DT,NN,VBZ,IN,NNP,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NNP,CC,IN,PRP,PRP,MD,RB,VB,VBN"
Cray Research did not want to fund a project that did not include Seymour,"NNP,NNP,VBD,RB,VB,TO,VB,DT,NN,WDT,VBD,RB,VB,NNP"
The documents also said that Cray Computer anticipates needing perhaps another 120 million in financing beginning next September,"DT,NNS,RB,VBD,IN,NNP,NNP,VBZ,VBG,RB,DT,CD,CD,IN,NN,VBG,JJ,NNP"
But Mr Barnum called that a worstcase scenario,"CC,NNP,NNP,VBD,IN,DT,JJ,NN"
The filing on the details of the spinoff caused Cray Research stock to jump 2875 yesterday to close at 38 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading,"DT,NN,IN,DT,NNS,IN,DT,NN,VBD,NNP,NNP,NN,TO,VB,CD,NN,TO,VB,IN,CD,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,JJ,NN"
Analysts noted yesterday that Cray Research's decision to link its 983 million promissory note to Mr Cray's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company,"NNS,VBD,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NN,TO,VB,PRP$,CD,CD,JJ,NN,TO,NNP,NNP,NN,MD,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN"

You either believe Seymour can do it again or you don't,"PRP,RB,VBP,NNP,MD,VB,PRP,RB,CC,PRP,VBP"
Besides the designer's age other risk factors for Mr Cray's new company include the Cray3's tricky unproven chip technology,"IN,DT,NN,NN,JJ,NN,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP,JJ,NN,VBP,DT,NNP,JJ,JJ,NN,NN"
The SEC documents describe those chips which are made of gallium arsenide as being so fragile and minute they will require special robotic handling equipment,"DT,NNP,NNS,VBP,DT,NNS,WDT,VBP,VBN,IN,NN,NN,IN,VBG,RB,JJ,CC,JJ,PRP,MD,VB,JJ,JJ,NN,NN"
In addition the Cray3 will contain 16 processors  twice as many as the largest current supercomputer,"IN,NN,DT,NNP,MD,VB,CD,NNS,CC,RB,RB,JJ,IN,DT,JJS,JJ,NN"
Cray Computer also will face intense competition not only from Cray Research which has about 60 of the worldwide supercomputer market and which is expected to roll out the C90 machine a direct competitor with the Cray3 in 1991,"NNP,NNP,RB,MD,VB,JJ,NN,RB,RB,IN,NNP,NNP,WDT,VBZ,RB,CD,IN,DT,JJ,NN,NN,CC,WDT,VBZ,VBN,TO,VB,RP,DT,NN,NN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NNP,IN,CD"

It's the latest investment craze sweeping Wall Street a rash of new closedend country funds those publicly traded portfolios that invest in stocks of a single foreign country,"PRP,DT,JJS,NN,NN,VBG,NNP,NNP,DT,NN,IN,JJ,JJ,NN,NNS,DT,RB,VBN,NNS,WDT,VBP,IN,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,JJ,NN"

The recent explosion of country funds mirrors the closedend fund mania of the 1920s Mr Foot says when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular,"DT,JJ,NN,IN,NN,NNS,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN,NN,IN,DT,NNS,NNP,NNP,VBZ,WRB,RB,VBN,NNS,VBD,RB,JJ"

The surge brings to nearly 50 the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in New York or London,"DT,NN,VBZ,TO,RB,CD,DT,NN,IN,NN,NNS,WDT,VBP,CC,RB,MD,VB,VBN,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP"

People are looking to stake their claims now before the number of available nations runs out says Michael Porter an analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham & Co New York,"NNS,VBP,VBG,TO,VB,PRP$,NNS,RB,RB,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,VBZ,RP,VBZ,NNP,NNP,DT,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP,NNP"

As individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy to sell,"IN,JJ,NNS,VBP,VBN,RB,IN,DT,NN,NN,IN,DT,NNS,NNS,NNS,VBP,VBN,TO,VB,JJ,NNS,WDT,NNS,VBP,JJ,TO,VB"
And the firms are stretching their nets far and wide to do it,"CC,DT,NNS,VBP,VBG,PRP$,NNS,RB,CC,RB,TO,VB,PRP"
Financial planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a smattering of international securities,"JJ,NNS,RB,VBP,NNS,TO,VB,CC,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS"
And many emerging markets have outpaced more mature markets such as the US and Japan,"CC,JJ,VBG,NNS,VBP,VBN,RBR,JJ,NNS,JJ,IN,DT,NNP,CC,NNP"
Country funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies,"NN,NNS,VBP,DT,JJ,NN,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,VBG,RP,JJ,NNS"
But it doesn't take much to get burned,"CC,PRP,VBZ,VB,JJ,TO,VB,VBN"
Political and currency gyrations can whipsaw the funds,"JJ,CC,NN,NNS,MD,VB,DT,NNS"
Another concern The funds' share prices tend to swing more than the broader market,"DT,NN,DT,NNS,NN,NNS,VBP,TO,VB,RBR,IN,DT,JJR,NN"
When the stock market dropped nearly 7 Oct 13 for instance the Mexico Fund plunged about 18 and the Spain Fund fell 16,"WRB,DT,NN,NN,VBD,RB,CD,NNP,CD,IN,NN,DT,NNP,NNP,VBD,RB,CD,CC,DT,NNP,NNP,VBD,CD"
And most country funds were clobbered more than most stocks after the 1987 crash,"CC,JJS,NN,NNS,VBD,VBN,RBR,IN,JJS,NNS,IN,DT,CD,NN"
What's so wild about the funds' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios,"WP,RB,JJ,IN,DT,NNS,NN,RB,RB,VBZ,IN,JJ,VBP,VBG,IN,RB,JJ,NNS,TO,DT,NN,IN,PRP$,JJ,NNS"
After trading at an average discount of more than 20 in late 1987 and part of last year country funds currently trade at an average premium of 6,"IN,VBG,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,JJR,IN,CD,IN,JJ,CD,CC,NN,IN,JJ,NN,NN,NNS,RB,VBP,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,CD"
The reason Share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks they hold,"DT,NN,NN,NNS,IN,JJ,IN,DT,NNS,DT,NN,VBP,VBN,RB,RBR,RB,IN,DT,JJ,NNS,PRP,VBP"
It's probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign investors such as South Korea some specialists say,"PRP,RB,IN,VBG,DT,NN,IN,NNS,WDT,VBP,IN,NNS,WDT,VBP,RB,VBN,TO,JJ,NNS,JJ,IN,NNP,NNP,DT,NNS,VBP"
But some European funds recently have skyrocketed; Spain Fund has surged to a startling 120 premium,"CC,DT,JJ,NNS,RB,VBP,VBN,NNP,NNP,VBZ,VBN,TO,DT,JJ,CD,NN"
It has been targeted by Japanese investors as a good longterm play tied to 1992's European economic integration,"PRP,VBZ,VBN,VBN,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,VBN,TO,CD,JJ,JJ,NN"
And several new funds that aren't even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums,"CC,JJ,JJ,NNS,WDT,VBP,RB,RB,VBN,RB,VBP,VBN,TO,VB,IN,JJ,NNS"
I'm very alarmed to see these rich valuations says Smith Barney's Mr Porter,"PRP,RB,VBN,TO,VB,DT,JJ,NNS,VBZ,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP"
The newly fattened premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds Mr Porter suggests,"DT,RB,VBN,NNS,VBP,DT,RB,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,NNS,NNP,NNP,VBZ"
Unlike many US investors those in Asia or Europe seeking foreignstock exposure may be less resistant to paying higher prices for country funds,"IN,JJ,NNP,NNS,DT,IN,NNP,CC,NNP,VBG,JJ,NN,MD,VB,RBR,JJ,TO,VBG,JJR,NNS,IN,NN,NNS"
There may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here Mr Porter says,"EX,MD,VB,DT,JJ,NN,VBN,IN,DT,NNS,VBN,RB,NNP,NNP,VBZ"
Nonetheless plenty of US analysts and money managers are aghast at the lofty trading levels of some country funds,"RB,JJ,IN,NNP,NNS,CC,NN,NNS,VBP,JJ,IN,DT,JJ,NN,NNS,IN,DT,NN,NNS"
They argue that US investors often can buy American depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds; these socalled ADRs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the US,"PRP,VBP,IN,NNP,NNS,RB,MD,VB,JJ,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,DT,JJ,NNPS,VBP,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,VBN,IN,DT,NNP"
That way investors can essentially buy the funds without paying the premium,"DT,NN,NNS,MD,RB,VB,DT,NNS,IN,VBG,DT,NN"
For people who insist on jumping in now to buy the funds Newgate's Mr Foot says The only advice I have for these folks is that those who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quickly,"IN,NNS,WP,VBP,RP,VBG,RB,RB,TO,VB,DT,NNS,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN,PRP,VBP,IN,DT,NNS,VBZ,IN,DT,WP,VBP,TO,DT,NN,RB,VBD,RBR,VB,JJ,TO,VB,RB"
The US and Soviet Union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by Moscow of 188 million in preCommunist Russian debts owed to the US government the State Department said,"DT,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP,VBP,VBG,JJ,NNS,IN,JJ,NN,IN,NNP,IN,CD,CD,IN,JJ,JJ,NNS,VBD,TO,DT,NNP,NN,DT,NNP,NNP,VBD"
If the debts are repaid it could clear the way for Soviet bonds to be sold in the US,"IN,DT,NNS,VBP,VBN,PRP,MD,VB,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,TO,VB,VBN,IN,DT,NNP"
However after two meetings with the Soviets a State Department spokesman said that it's too early to say whether that will happen,"RB,IN,CD,NNS,IN,DT,NNS,DT,NNP,NNP,NN,VBD,IN,PRP,RB,RB,TO,VB,IN,DT,MD,VB"
Coincident with the talks the State Department said it has permitted a Soviet bank to open a New York branch,"JJ,IN,DT,NNS,DT,NNP,NNP,VBD,PRP,VBZ,VBN,DT,JJ,NN,TO,VB,DT,NNP,NNP,NN"
The branch of the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs was approved last spring and opened in July,"DT,NN,IN,DT,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBD,VBN,JJ,NN,CC,VBD,IN,NNP"
But a Soviet bank here would be crippled unless Moscow found a way to settle the 188 million debt which was lent to the country's shortlived democratic Kerensky government before the Communists seized power in 1917,"CC,DT,JJ,NN,RB,MD,VB,VBN,IN,NNP,VBD,DT,NN,TO,VB,DT,CD,CD,NN,WDT,VBD,VBN,TO,DT,NN,JJ,JJ,NNP,NN,IN,DT,NNS,VBD,NN,IN,CD"
Under a 1934 law the Johnson Debt Default Act as amended it's illegal for Americans to extend credit to countries in default to the US government unless they are members of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund,"IN,DT,CD,NN,DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,RB,VBN,PRP,JJ,IN,NNS,TO,VB,NN,TO,NNS,IN,NN,TO,DT,NNP,NN,IN,PRP,VBP,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP,NNP"
The USSR belongs to neither organization,"DT,NNP,VBZ,TO,DT,NN"
Moscow has settled pre1917 debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value,"NNP,VBZ,VBN,JJ,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,JJR,IN,NN,NN"
The State Department stressed the pre1933 debts as the key to satisfying the Johnson Act,"DT,NNP,NNP,VBD,DT,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NN,TO,VBG,DT,NNP,NNP"
But the Soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the US until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the World War II lendlease program,"CC,DT,NNS,MD,RB,VB,JJ,NNS,TO,VBG,NN,IN,DT,NNP,IN,PRP,VBP,NNS,IN,NNS,IN,NNS,IN,JJ,NN,RB,JJ,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,JJ,NN"
In another reflection that the growth of the economy is leveling off the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in September,"IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,VBG,RP,DT,NN,VBD,IN,NNS,IN,VBN,NNS,CC,NN,IN,NN,VBD,TO,VB,IN,NNP"
Meanwhile the National Association of Purchasing Management said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in October for the sixth consecutive month,"RB,DT,NNP,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,VBD,PRP$,JJS,NN,VBD,IN,DT,NN,NN,VBD,IN,NNP,IN,DT,JJ,JJ,NN"
Its index inched up to 476 in October from 46 in September,"PRP$,NN,VBD,RB,TO,CD,IN,NNP,IN,CD,IN,NNP"
Any reading below 50 suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining,"DT,NN,IN,CD,VBZ,DT,NN,NN,VBZ,RB,VBG"
The purchasing managers however also said that orders turned up in October after four months of decline,"DT,VBG,NNS,RB,RB,VBD,IN,NNS,VBD,RB,IN,NNP,IN,CD,NNS,IN,NN"
Factories booked 23674 billion in orders in September nearly the same as the 23679 billion in August the Commerce Department said,"NNS,VBD,CD,CD,IN,NNS,IN,NNP,RB,DT,JJ,IN,DT,CD,CD,IN,NNP,DT,NNP,NNP,VBD"
If not for a 596 surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors factory orders would have fallen 21,"IN,RB,IN,DT,CD,NN,IN,NNS,IN,NN,NNS,IN,NN,NNS,NN,NNS,MD,VB,VBN,CD"
In a separate report the department said construction spending ran at an annual rate of 4156 billion not significantly different from the 4158 billion reported for August,"IN,DT,JJ,NN,DT,NN,VBD,NN,NN,VBD,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,CD,CD,RB,RB,JJ,IN,DT,CD,CD,VBN,IN,NNP"
Private construction spending was down but government building activity was up,"JJ,NN,NN,VBD,RB,CC,NN,NN,NN,VBD,RB"
The figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns but weren't adjusted for inflation,"DT,NNS,IN,DT,NNS,VBD,VBN,TO,VB,DT,NNS,IN,JJ,JJ,NNS,CC,VBD,VBN,IN,NN"
Kenneth Mayland economist for Society Corp a Cleveland bank said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to taper off,"NNP,NNP,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,DT,NNP,NN,VBD,NN,IN,NNS,IN,NN,NNS,VBZ,VBG,TO,VB,RP"
At the same time the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry,"IN,DT,JJ,NN,DT,NN,IN,NN,NNS,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,VBN,TO,VB,DT,JJ,NN,NN"
What sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack? he asked,"WP,NN,VBZ,VBG,RB,TO,VB,RP,DT,NN,PRP,VBD"
I draw a blank,"PRP,VBP,DT,NN"
By most measures the nation's industrial sector is now growing very slowly  if at all,"IN,JJS,NNS,DT,NN,JJ,NN,VBZ,RB,VBG,RB,RB,CC,IN,IN,DT"
Factory payrolls fell in September,"NN,NNS,VBD,IN,NNP"
So did the Federal Reserve Board's industrialproduction index,"RB,VBD,DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,JJ,NN"
Yet many economists aren't predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession,"CC,JJ,NNS,VBP,VBG,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,IN,TO,VB,IN,NN"
They cite a lack of imbalances that provide early warning signals of a downturn,"PRP,VBP,DT,NN,IN,NNS,WDT,VBP,JJ,NN,NNS,IN,DT,NN"
Inventories are closely watched for such clues for instance,"NNS,VBP,RB,VBN,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,NN"
Economists say a buildup in inventories can provoke cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession,"NNS,VBP,DT,NN,IN,NNS,MD,VB,NNS,IN,NN,WDT,MD,VB,TO,DT,NN"
But yesterday's factory orders report had good news on that front it said factory inventories fell 01 in September the first decline since February 1987,"CC,NN,NN,NNS,NN,VBD,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,PRP,VBD,NN,NNS,VBD,CD,IN,NNP,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NNP,CD"
This conforms to the soft landing ' scenario said Elliott Platt an economist at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp,"DT,VBZ,TO,DT,JJ,NN,DT,NN,VBD,NNP,NNP,DT,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP,NNP"
I don't see any signs that inventories are excessive,"PRP,VBP,VB,DT,NNS,IN,NNS,VBP,JJ"
A soft landing is an economic slowdown that eases inflation without leading to a recession,"DT,JJ,NN,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN,WDT,VBZ,NN,IN,VBG,TO,DT,NN"
The department said orders for nondurable goods  those intended to last fewer than three years  fell 03 in September to 10973 billion after climbing 09 the month before,"DT,NN,VBD,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,CC,DT,VBN,TO,VB,JJR,IN,CD,NNS,CC,VBD,CD,IN,NNP,TO,CD,CD,RB,VBG,CD,DT,NN,RB"
Orders for durable goods were up 02 to 12703 billion after rising 39 the month before,"NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,VBD,RB,CD,TO,CD,CD,IN,VBG,CD,DT,NN,RB"
The department previously estimated that durablegoods orders fell 01 in September,"DT,NN,RB,VBD,IN,NNS,NNS,VBD,CD,IN,NNP"
Factory shipments fell 16 to 2344 billion after rising 54 in August,"NN,NNS,VBD,CD,TO,CD,CD,IN,VBG,CD,IN,NNP"
Shipments have been relatively level since January the Commerce Department noted,"NNS,VBP,VBN,RB,JJ,IN,NNP,DT,NNP,NNP,VBD"
Manufacturers' backlogs of unfilled orders rose 05 in September to 49734 billion helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector,"NNS,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,VBD,CD,IN,NNP,TO,CD,CD,VBN,IN,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,NNS,NN"
Excluding these orders backlogs declined 03,"VBG,DT,NNS,NNS,VBD,CD"
In its construction spending report the Commerce Department said residential construction which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending was off 09 in September to an annual rate of 1919 billion,"IN,PRP$,NN,NN,NN,DT,NNP,NNP,VBD,JJ,NN,WDT,VBZ,IN,RB,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,VBD,JJ,CD,IN,NNP,TO,DT,JJ,NN,IN,CD,CD"

Government construction spending rose 43 to 88 billion,"NNP,NN,NN,VBD,CD,TO,CD,CD"
After adjusting for inflation the Commerce Department said construction spending didn't change in September,"RB,VBG,IN,NN,DT,NNP,NNP,VBD,NN,NN,VBD,VB,IN,NNP"
For the first nine months of the year total construction spending ran about 2 above last year's level,"IN,DT,JJ,CD,NNS,IN,DT,NN,JJ,NN,NN,VBD,RB,CD,IN,JJ,NN,NN"
The government's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by McGrawHill Inc's FW Dodge Group,"DT,NN,NN,NN,NNS,VBP,IN,DT,NN,VBD,RBR,IN,DT,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP"
Dodge reported an 8 increase in construction contracts awarded in September,"NNP,VBD,DT,CD,NN,IN,NN,NNS,VBN,IN,NNP"
The goverment counts money as it is spent; Dodge counts contracts when they are awarded,"DT,NN,VBZ,NN,IN,PRP,VBZ,VBN,NNP,VBZ,NNS,WRB,PRP,VBP,VBN"
The government includes money spent on residential renovation; Dodge doesn't,"DT,NN,VBZ,NN,VBN,IN,JJ,NN,NNP,VBZ"
Although the purchasing managers' index continues to indicate a slowing economy it isn't signaling an imminent recession said Robert Bretz chairman of the association's survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc Stamford Conn,"IN,DT,NN,NNS,NN,VBZ,TO,VB,DT,VBG,NN,PRP,VBZ,VBG,DT,JJ,NN,VBD,NNP,NNP,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,NN,CC,NN,IN,NNS,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP"

The report offered new evidence that the nation's export growth though still continuing may be slowing,"DT,NN,VBD,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,NN,IN,RB,VBG,MD,VB,VBG"
Only 19 of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in October down from 27 in September,"RB,CD,IN,DT,VBG,NNS,VBD,JJR,NN,NNS,IN,NNP,RB,IN,CD,IN,NNP"
And 8 said export orders were down last month compared with 6 the month before,"CC,CD,VBD,NN,NNS,VBD,RB,JJ,NN,VBN,IN,CD,DT,NN,RB"
The purhasing managers' report also added evidence that inflation is under control,"DT,NN,NNS,NN,RB,VBD,NN,IN,NN,VBZ,IN,NN"
For the fifth consecutive month purchasing managers said prices for the goods they purchased fell,"IN,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,VBG,NNS,VBD,NNS,IN,DT,NNS,PRP,VBD,VBD"
The decline was even steeper than in September,"DT,NN,VBD,RB,JJR,IN,IN,NNP"
They also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in October than they had for each of the five previous months,"PRP,RB,VBD,IN,NNS,VBD,VBG,NNS,RBR,RB,IN,NNP,IN,PRP,VBD,IN,DT,IN,DT,CD,JJ,NNS"
Economists consider that a sign that inflationary pressures are abating,"NNS,VBP,DT,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,VBP,VBG"
When demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times lengthen prices tend to rise,"WRB,NN,VBZ,JJR,IN,NNS,MD,VB,CC,NN,NNS,VBP,NNS,VBP,TO,VB"
The purchasing managers' report is based on data provided by more than 250 purchasing executives,"DT,NN,NNS,NN,VBZ,VBN,IN,NNS,VBN,IN,RBR,IN,CD,NN,NNS"
Each of the survey's indicators gauges the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening,"DT,IN,DT,NN,NNS,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,NNS,VBG,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,CC,DT,NN,VBG,DT,NN"
For the first time the October survey polled members on imports,"IN,DT,JJ,NN,DT,NNP,NN,VBD,NNS,IN,NNS"
It found that of the 73 who import 10 said they imported more in October and 12 said they imported less than the previous month,"PRP,VBD,IN,IN,DT,CD,WP,VBP,CD,VBD,PRP,VBD,RBR,IN,NNP,CC,CD,VBD,PRP,VBD,JJR,IN,DT,JJ,NN"
While acknowledging one month's figures don't prove a trend Mr Bretz said It does lead you to suspect imports are going down or at least not increasing that much,"IN,VBG,CD,NN,NNS,VBP,VB,DT,NN,NNP,NNP,VBD,PRP,VBZ,VB,PRP,TO,VB,NNS,VBP,VBG,RB,CC,IN,JJS,RB,VBG,RB,RB"

It's an odd thing to put on the list Mr Bretz noted,"PRP,DT,JJ,NN,TO,VB,IN,DT,NN,NNP,NNP,VBD"
He said that for the second month in a row food processors reported a shortage of nonfat dry milk,"PRP,VBD,IN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,NNS,VBD,DT,NN,IN,JJ,JJ,NN"

That commercial  which said Mr Coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion even in cases of rape and incest a charge Mr Coleman denies  changed the dynamics of the campaign transforming it at least in part into a referendum on abortion,"DT,JJ,CC,WDT,VBD,NNP,NNP,VBD,TO,VB,RP,DT,NN,IN,NN,RB,IN,NNS,IN,NN,CC,NN,DT,NN,NNP,NNP,VBZ,CC,VBD,DT,NNS,IN,DT,NN,VBG,PRP,IN,JJS,IN,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,NN"

And the nose on Mr Courter's face grows,"CC,DT,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NN,VBZ"
The only fraud involved cry Mr Courter's partisans is the Florio commercial itself and so the Courter campaign has responded with its own Pinocchio commercial produced by Mr Ailes,"DT,JJ,NN,VBN,VBP,NNP,NNP,NNS,VBZ,DT,NNP,NN,PRP,CC,RB,DT,NNP,NN,VBZ,VBN,IN,PRP$,JJ,NNP,NN,VBN,IN,NNP,NNP"

In her wake she left the bitterness and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a betrayer; of colleagues who say she brought them shame; of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated harshly; and of schooldistrict officials stunned that despite the baldfaced nature of her actions she became something of a local martyr,"IN,PRP$,NN,PRP,VBD,DT,NN,CC,NN,IN,DT,NN,WP,VBD,PRP$,NN,CC,RB,VBZ,PRP,DT,NN,IN,NNS,WP,VBP,PRP,VBD,PRP,NN,IN,NNS,CC,NNS,WP,VBD,PRP,CC,VBP,PRP,VBD,VBN,RB,CC,IN,NN,NNS,JJ,IN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,PRP$,NNS,PRP,VBD,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN"

But others at Greenville High say she was eager to win  if not for money then for pride and recognition,"CC,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP,VB,PRP,VBD,JJ,TO,VB,CC,JJ,RB,IN,NN,RB,IN,NN,CC,NN"
Mary Elizabeth Ariail another socialstudies teacher says she believed Mrs Yeargin wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that wouldn't demand good hearing,"NNP,NNP,NNP,DT,NN,NN,VBZ,PRP,VBD,NNP,NNP,VBD,TO,VB,PRP,NN,RB,IN,PRP,MD,VB,DT,JJ,NN,WDT,MD,VB,JJ,NN"
Indeed Mrs Yeargin was interested in a possible job with the state teacher cadet program,"RB,NNP,NNP,VBD,JJ,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,NN,NN"
Last March after attending a teaching seminar in Washington Mrs Yeargin says she returned to Greenville two days before annual testing feeling that she hadn't prepared her lowability geography students adequately,"JJ,NNP,IN,VBG,DT,NN,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBZ,PRP,VBD,TO,NNP,CD,NNS,IN,JJ,NN,VBG,IN,PRP,VBD,VBN,PRP$,JJ,NN,NNS,RB"
When test booklets were passed out 48 hours ahead of time she says she copied questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students,"WRB,NN,NNS,VBD,VBN,RB,CD,NNS,RB,IN,NN,PRP,VBZ,PRP,VBD,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NNS,NN,CC,VBD,DT,NNS,TO,NNS"
Mrs Yeargin admits she made a big mistake but insists her motives were correct,"NNP,NNP,VBZ,PRP,VBD,DT,JJ,NN,CC,VBZ,PRP$,NNS,VBD,JJ"
I was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation she says,"PRP,VBD,VBG,TO,VB,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NN,NN,PRP,VBZ"
Only five of the 40 questions were geography questions,"RB,CD,IN,DT,CD,NNS,VBD,NN,NNS"
The rest were history sociology finance  subjects they never had,"DT,NN,VBD,NN,NN,NN,CC,NNS,PRP,RB,VBD"
Mrs Yeargin says that she also wanted to help lift Greenville High School's overall test scores usually near the bottom of 14 district high schools in rankings carried annually by local newspapers,"NNP,NNP,VBZ,IN,PRP,RB,VBD,TO,VB,VB,NNP,NNP,NNP,JJ,NN,NNS,RB,IN,DT,NN,IN,CD,NN,JJ,NNS,IN,NNS,VBN,RB,IN,JJ,NNS"
Mostly she says she wanted to prevent the damage to selfesteem that her lowability students would suffer from doing badly on the test,"RB,PRP,VBZ,PRP,VBD,TO,VB,DT,NN,TO,NN,IN,PRP$,JJ,NNS,MD,VB,IN,VBG,RB,IN,DT,NN"
These kids broke my heart she says,"DT,NNS,VBD,PRP$,NN,PRP,VBZ"
A whole day goes by and no one even knows they're alive,"DT,JJ,NN,VBZ,RB,CC,DT,NN,RB,VBZ,PRP,JJ"
They desperately needed somebody who showed they cared for them who loved them,"PRP,RB,VBD,NN,WP,VBD,PRP,VBD,IN,PRP,WP,VBD,PRP"
The last thing they needed was another dragdown blow,"DT,JJ,NN,PRP,VBD,VBD,DT,JJ,NN"
School officials and prosecutors say Mrs Yeargin is lying,"NNP,NNS,CC,NNS,VB,NNP,NNP,VBZ,VBG"
They found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help although because the case wasn't tried in court this evidence was never presented publicly,"PRP,VBD,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NN,DT,NN,RB,WP,VBD,PRP,VBD,PRP,JJ,NN,IN,IN,DT,NN,VBD,VBN,IN,NN,DT,NN,VBD,RB,VBN,RB"
That pretty much defeats any inkling that she was out to help the poor underprivileged child says Joe Watson the prosecutor in the case who is also president of Greenville High School's alumni association,"DT,RB,RB,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,PRP,VBD,RP,TO,VB,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,VBZ,NNP,NNP,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,WP,VBZ,RB,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNS,NN"
Mrs Yeargin concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class adding I wanted to help all students,"NNP,NNP,VBZ,IN,PRP,VBD,RB,DT,NNS,IN,DT,JJR,NN,VBG,PRP,VBD,TO,VB,DT,NNS"
Mr Watson says Mrs Yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair,"NNP,NNP,VBZ,NNP,NNP,RB,VBD,TO,NN,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NN,VBD,JJ"
Do I have much sympathy for her? Mr Watson asks,"VBP,PRP,VB,JJ,NN,IN,PRP,NNP,NNP,VBZ"
Not really,"RB,RB"
I believe in the system,"PRP,VBP,IN,DT,NN"
I believe you have to use the system to change it,"PRP,VBP,PRP,VBP,TO,VB,DT,NN,TO,VB,PRP"
What she did was like taking the law into your own hands,"WP,PRP,VBD,VBD,IN,VBG,DT,NN,IN,PRP$,JJ,NNS"
Mrs Ward says that when the cheating was discovered she wanted to avoid the moraledamaging public disclosure that a trial would bring,"NNP,NNP,VBZ,IN,WRB,DT,NN,VBD,VBN,PRP,VBD,TO,VB,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,MD,VB"
She says she offered Mrs Yeargin a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate,"PRP,VBZ,PRP,VBD,NNP,NNP,DT,JJ,NN,CC,VBD,PRP,MD,VB,VB,PRP,NN,NN"
Mrs Yeargin declined,"NNP,NNP,VBD"
She said something like You just want to make it easy for the school ',"PRP,VBD,NN,IN,PRP,RB,VBP,TO,VB,PRP,JJ,IN,DT,NN,DT"
I was dumbfounded Mrs Ward recalls,"PRP,VBD,JJ,NNP,NNP,VBZ"
It was like someone had turned a knife in me,"PRP,VBD,IN,NN,VBD,VBN,DT,NN,IN,PRP"
To the astonishment and dismay of her superiors and legal authorities  and perhaps as a measure of the unpopularity of standardized tests  Mrs Yeargin won widespread local support,"TO,DT,NN,CC,NN,IN,PRP$,NNS,CC,JJ,NNS,CC,JJ,RB,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,CC,NNP,NNP,VBD,JJ,JJ,NN"
The schoolboard hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf,"DT,NN,NN,IN,WDT,PRP,VBD,VBN,VBD,VBN,IN,NNS,NNS,CC,NNS,WP,VBD,TO,VB,IN,PRP$,NN"
Supportive callers decried unfair testing not Mrs Yeargin on a local radio talk show on which she appeared,"JJ,NNS,VBD,JJ,NN,RB,NNP,NNP,IN,DT,JJ,NN,NN,NN,IN,WDT,PRP,VBD"
The show didn't give the particulars of Mrs Yeargin's offense saying only that she helped students do better on the test,"DT,NN,VBD,VB,DT,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP,NN,VBG,RB,IN,PRP,VBD,NNS,VB,RBR,IN,DT,NN"
The message to the board of education out of all this is we 've got to take a serious look at how we're doing our curriculum and our testing policies in this state said the talkshow host,"DT,NN,TO,DT,NN,IN,NN,IN,IN,PDT,DT,VBZ,PRP,VBP,VBN,TO,VB,DT,JJ,NN,IN,WRB,PRP,VBG,PRP$,NN,CC,PRP$,NN,NNS,IN,DT,NN,VBD,DT,NN,NN"
Editorials in the Greenville newspaper allowed that Mrs Yeargin was wrong but also said the case showed how testing was being overused,"NNS,IN,DT,NNP,NN,VBD,IN,NNP,NNP,VBD,JJ,CC,RB,VBD,DT,NN,VBD,WRB,NN,VBD,VBG,VBN"
The radio show enraged us says Mrs Ward,"DT,NN,NN,VBD,PRP,VBZ,NNP,NNP"
Partly because of the show Mr Watson says the district decided not to recommend Mrs Yeargin for a firsttime offenders program that could have expunged the charges and the conviction from her record,"RB,IN,IN,DT,NN,NNP,NNP,VBZ,DT,NN,VBD,RB,TO,VB,NNP,NNP,IN,DT,JJ,NNS,NN,WDT,MD,VB,VBN,DT,NNS,CC,DT,NN,IN,PRP$,NN"
And legal authorities cranked up an investigation worthy of a murder case,"CC,JJ,NNS,VBD,RP,DT,NN,JJ,IN,DT,NN,NN"
Over 50 witnesses mostly students were interviewed,"IN,CD,NNS,RB,NNS,VBD,VBN"

There may be others doing what she did,"EX,MD,VB,NNS,VBG,WP,PRP,VBD"
Mrs Yeargin says she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win reinstatement and because she was afraid of further charges,"NNP,NNP,VBZ,PRP,VBD,JJ,IN,PRP,VBD,PRP,MD,RB,RBR,VB,JJ,TO,VB,NN,CC,IN,PRP,VBD,JJ,IN,JJ,NNS"

Worksheets in a testpractice kit called Learning Materials sold to schools across the country by Macmillan/McGrawHill School Publishing Co contain the same questions,"NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NN,VBN,NNP,NNPS,VBN,TO,NNS,IN,DT,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBP,DT,JJ,NNS"
In many other instances there is almost no difference between the real test and Learning Materials,"IN,JJ,JJ,NNS,EX,VBZ,RB,DT,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,CC,NNP,NNPS"

Close parallels between tests and practice tests are common some educators and researchers say,"JJ,NNS,IN,NNS,CC,NN,NNS,VBP,JJ,DT,NNS,CC,NNS,VBP"
Testpreparation booklets software and worksheets are a booming publishing subindustry,"JJ,NNS,NN,CC,NNS,VBP,DT,VBG,VBG,NN"
But some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of schoolsponsored cheating,"CC,DT,NN,NNS,VBP,RB,JJ,TO,DT,NNS,PRP,IN,NNS,VBP,PRP,VBP,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NN"

It's as if France decided to give only French history questions to students in a European history class and when everybody aces the test they say their kids are good in European history says John Cannell an Albuquerque NM psychiatrist and founder of an educational research organization Friends for Education which has studied standardized testing,"PRP,IN,IN,NNP,VBD,TO,VB,JJ,JJ,NN,NNS,TO,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NN,NN,CC,WRB,NN,VBZ,DT,NN,PRP,VBP,PRP$,NNS,VBP,JJ,IN,JJ,NN,VBZ,NNP,NNP,DT,NNP,NNP,NN,CC,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,NN,NNPS,IN,NNP,WDT,VBZ,VBN,JJ,NN"

The materials in each set reach about 90 students,"DT,NNS,IN,DT,NN,VBP,IN,CD,NNS"
Scoring High and Learning Materials are the bestselling preparation tests,"NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,NNPS,VBP,DT,JJS,NN,NNS"
Michael Kean director of marketing for CTB Macmillan/McGraw the Macmillan/McGraw division that publishes Learning Materials says it isn't aimed at improving test scores,"NNP,NNP,NN,IN,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,DT,NNP,NN,WDT,VBZ,NNP,NNPS,VBZ,PRP,VBZ,VBN,IN,VBG,NN,NNS"
He also asserted that exact questions weren't replicated,"PRP,RB,VBD,IN,JJ,NNS,VBD,VBN"
When referred to the questions that matched he said it was coincidental,"WRB,VBN,TO,DT,NNS,WDT,VBN,PRP,VBD,PRP,VBD,JJ"
Mr Kaminski the schoolteacher and William Mehrens a Michigan State University education professor concluded in a study last June that CAT test versions of Scoring High and Learning Materials shouldn't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test,"NNP,NNP,DT,NN,CC,NNP,NNP,DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,NN,NN,VBD,IN,DT,NN,JJ,NNP,IN,NNP,NN,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,NNPS,MD,VB,VBN,IN,DT,NN,IN,IN,PRP$,NN,TO,DT,JJ,NN"
They devised a 69point scale  awarding one point for each subskill measured on the CAT test  to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifthgrade CAT,"PRP,VBD,DT,JJ,NN,CC,VBG,CD,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBN,IN,DT,NNP,NN,CC,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,NN,NNS,TO,DT,NN,NNP"
Because many of these subskills  the symmetry of geometrical figures metric measurement of volume or pie and bar graphs for example  are only a small part of the total fifthgrade curriculum Mr Kaminski says the preparation kits wouldn't replicate too many if their real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with test procedures,"IN,JJ,IN,DT,NNS,CC,JJ,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,JJ,NN,IN,NN,CC,NN,CC,NN,NNS,IN,NN,CC,NN,RB,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,NN,NNP,NNP,VBZ,DT,NN,NNS,MD,VB,RB,JJ,IN,PRP$,JJ,NN,VBD,JJ,NN,CC,RB,JJ,NN,IN,NN,NNS"
But Learning Materials matched on 665 of 69 subskills,"CC,NNP,NNPS,VBD,IN,CD,IN,CD,NNS"
Scoring High matched on 645,"NNP,NNP,VBD,IN,CD"
In CAT sections where students' knowledge of twoletter consonant sounds is tested the authors noted that Scoring High concentrated on the same sounds that the test does  to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth graders should know,"IN,NNP,NNS,WRB,NNS,NN,IN,JJ,JJ,NNS,VBZ,VBN,DT,NNS,VBD,IN,NNP,NNP,VBD,IN,DT,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,CC,IN,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,MD,VB"

Rick Brownell senior editor of Scoring High says that Messrs Kaminski and Mehrens are ignoring the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format,"NNP,NNP,JJ,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,VBZ,IN,NNPS,NNP,CC,NNP,VBP,VBG,DT,NN,NNS,VBP,IN,VBG,JJ,IN,NNS,CC,NN,NN"

When Scoring High first came out in 1979 it was a publication of Random House,"WRB,NNP,NNP,RB,VBD,RB,IN,CD,PRP,VBD,DT,NN,IN,NNP,NNP"
McGrawHill was outraged,"NNP,VBD,JJ"
In a 1985 advisory to educators McGrawHill said Scoring High shouldn't be used because it represented a parallel form of the CAT and CTBS tests,"IN,DT,CD,NN,TO,NNS,NNP,VBD,NNP,NNP,MD,VB,VBN,IN,PRP,VBD,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NNP,CC,NNP,NNS"
But in 1988 McGrawHill purchased the Random House unit that publishes Scoring High which later became part of Macmillan/McGraw,"CC,IN,CD,NNP,VBD,DT,NNP,NNP,NN,WDT,VBZ,NNP,NNP,WDT,RBR,VBD,NN,IN,NNP"
Messrs Brownell and Kean say they are unaware of any efforts by McGrawHill to modify or discontinue Scoring High,"NNPS,NNP,CC,NNP,VBP,PRP,VBP,JJ,IN,DT,NNS,IN,NNP,TO,VB,CC,VB,NNP,NNP"

The Department of Health and Human Services plans to extend its moratorium on federal funding of research involving fetaltissue transplants,"DT,NNP,IN,NNP,CC,NNP,NNPS,VBZ,TO,VB,PRP$,NN,IN,JJ,NN,IN,NN,VBG,JJ,NNS"
Medical researchers believe the transplantation of small amounts of fetal tissue into humans could help treat juvenile diabetes and such degenerative diseases as Alzheimer's Parkinson's and Huntington's,"JJ,NNS,VBP,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,JJ,NN,IN,NNS,MD,VB,VB,JJ,NN,CC,JJ,JJ,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP"

The controversy began in 1987 when the National Institutes of Health aware of the policy implications of its research asked for an HHS review of its plan to implant fetal tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from Parkinson's disease,"DT,NN,VBD,IN,CD,WRB,DT,NNP,NNPS,IN,NNP,JJ,IN,DT,NN,NNS,IN,PRP$,NN,VBD,IN,DT,NNP,NN,IN,PRP$,NN,TO,VB,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,IN,NNPS,NN"
The department placed a moratorium on the research pending a review of scientific legal and ethical issues,"DT,NN,VBD,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBG,DT,NN,IN,JJ,JJ,CC,JJ,NNS"
A majority of an NIHappointed panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions but the issue became embroiled in politics as antiabortion groups continued to oppose federal funding,"DT,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,VBD,RB,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,VB,IN,RB,JJ,NNS,CC,DT,NN,VBD,VBN,IN,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,VBD,TO,VB,JJ,NN"

Dr Novello is deputy director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,"NNP,NNP,VBZ,NN,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP"

The warnings issued to at least 100 criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar who claim the information is protected by attorneyclient privilege,"DT,NNS,VBN,TO,IN,JJS,CD,NN,NN,NNS,IN,JJ,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NN,VBP,VBN,TO,DT,NN,IN,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NN,WP,VBP,DT,NN,VBZ,VBN,IN,JJ,NN"
The IRS warnings stem from a 1984 law that requires anyone who receives more than 10000 in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions in the course of trade or business to report the payment on a document known as Form 8300,"DT,NNP,NNS,VBP,IN,DT,CD,NN,WDT,VBZ,NN,WP,VBZ,JJR,IN,CD,IN,NN,IN,DT,NN,CC,NN,IN,CD,CC,JJR,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NN,IN,NN,CC,NN,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBN,IN,NN,CD"

Attorneys have argued since 1985 when the law took effect that they can not provide information about clients who don't wish their identities to be known,"NNS,VBP,VBN,IN,CD,WRB,DT,NN,VBD,NN,IN,PRP,MD,RB,VB,NN,IN,NNS,WP,VBP,VB,PRP$,NNS,TO,VB,VBN"
Many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the IRS in recent years citing attorneyclient privilege,"JJ,NNS,VBP,VBN,JJ,NNS,TO,DT,NNP,IN,JJ,NNS,VBG,JJ,NN"
Until last week the IRS rarely acted on the incomplete forms,"IN,JJ,NN,DT,NNP,RB,VBD,IN,DT,JJ,NNS"

The IRS is asking lawyers to redflag a criminal problem to the government added Mr Sonnett a Miami lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the computergenerated IRS forms sent by certified mail,"DT,NNP,VBZ,VBG,NNS,TO,VB,DT,JJ,NN,TO,DT,NN,VBD,NNP,NNP,DT,NNP,NN,WP,VBZ,VBN,IN,NNS,IN,NNS,WP,VBD,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,CC,VBZ,PRP,VBD,DT,JJ,NNP,NNS,VBN,IN,JJ,NN"
Mr Sonnett said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who don't have domestic bank accounts,"NNP,NNP,VBD,IN,NNS,WP,VBP,NN,MD,VB,VBN,NN,NNS,WP,VBP,VB,JJ,NN,NNS"
These individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers,"DT,NNS,MD,RB,RB,VB,IN,NN,WRB,PRP,VBP,NNS"
Mr Sonnett said there also may be other circumstances under which individuals wouldn't want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers,"NNP,NNP,VBD,EX,RB,MD,VB,JJ,NNS,IN,WDT,NNS,MD,VB,DT,NN,TO,VB,PRP,VBD,VBN,JJ,NN,NNS"

Mr Ross said IRS officials opposed the Justice Department's moderate stance on the matter,"NNP,NNP,VBD,NNP,NNS,VBD,DT,NNP,NNP,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN"
But in the letters sent in recent days Christopher J Lezovich of the IRS computing center in Detroit told attorneys that failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in summons enforcement action being initiated,"CC,IN,DT,NNS,VBN,IN,JJ,NNS,NNP,NNP,NNP,IN,DT,NNP,NN,NN,IN,NNP,VBD,NNS,IN,VBG,TO,RB,VB,DT,VBN,NN,MD,VB,IN,NN,NN,NN,VBG,VBN"

Prosecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business,"NNS,VBP,NN,NN,TO,VB,DT,NN,NNS,IN,DT,NN,CC,DT,NN"

Douglas Madison a corporate trader with Bank of America in Los Angeles traced the dollar's recent solid performance against the yen to purchases of securities by Japanese insurance companies and trust banks and the sense that another wave of investment is waiting in the wings,"NNP,NNP,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NNP,IN,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,VBD,DT,NN,JJ,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,TO,NNS,IN,NNS,IN,JJ,NN,NNS,CC,NN,NNS,CC,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,NN,VBZ,VBG,IN,DT,NNS"

J Landis Martin NL president and chief executive officer said NL and Mr Simmons cut the price they were proposing for Georgia Gulf because they initially planned a transaction that included about 250 million in equity and a substantial amount of highyield subordinated debt,"NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NN,CC,JJ,NN,NN,VBD,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP,VBD,DT,NN,PRP,VBD,VBG,IN,NNP,NNP,IN,PRP,RB,VBD,DT,NN,WDT,VBD,RB,CD,CD,IN,NN,CC,DT,JJ,NN,IN,JJ,VBN,NN"

So it goes in the competitive world of consumer banking these days,"IN,PRP,VBZ,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NN,VBG,DT,NNS"
For nearly a decade banks have competed for customers primarily with the interest rates they pay on their deposits and charge on their loans,"IN,RB,DT,NN,NNS,VBP,VBN,IN,NNS,RB,IN,DT,NN,NNS,PRP,VBP,IN,PRP$,NNS,CC,VB,IN,PRP$,NNS"
The competitive rates were generally offset by hefty fees on various services,"DT,JJ,NNS,VBD,RB,VBN,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS"
But many banks are turning away from strict price competition,"CC,JJ,NNS,VBP,VBG,RB,IN,JJ,NN,NN"

Varying age geography and lifestyle differences create numerous submarkets Ms MacDonald says,"JJ,NN,NN,CC,NN,NNS,VBP,JJ,NNS,NNP,NNP,VBZ"

The concept begot a slew of copycats but the banks stopped promoting the packages,"DT,NN,VBD,DT,NN,IN,NNS,CC,DT,NNS,VBD,VBG,DT,NNS"
One big reason thin margins,"CD,JJ,NN,JJ,NNS"
Many banks particularly smaller ones were slow to computerize and couldn't target market niches that would have made the programs more profitable,"JJ,NNS,RB,JJR,NNS,VBD,JJ,TO,VB,CC,MD,VB,NN,NNS,WDT,MD,VB,VBN,DT,NNS,RBR,JJ"
As banks' earnings were squeezed in the mid1970s the emphasis switched to finding ways to cut costs,"IN,NNS,NNS,VBD,VBN,IN,DT,CD,DT,NN,VBN,TO,VBG,NNS,TO,VB,NNS"
But now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age income and geography,"CC,RB,NNS,VBP,VBG,JJR,NNS,TO,VB,PRP$,NNS,IN,NN,NN,CC,NN"
They are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s,"PRP,VBP,RBR,JJ,TO,VB,TO,DT,NNS,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,WDT,VBD,IN,DT,JJ,CD"
Deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits as well as opened up the field for new products such as highrate CDs,"NN,VBZ,RB,VBN,DT,NNS,IN,WP,NNS,MD,VB,IN,NNS,RB,RB,IN,VBN,RP,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,JJ,IN,JJ,NNS"

This much fragmentation makes attracting and keeping today's ratesensitive customers costly,"DT,JJ,NN,VBZ,VBG,CC,VBG,NN,JJ,NNS,JJ"
Packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place,"NNS,VBP,NN,IN,VBG,NNS,IN,VBG,DT,NN,IN,PRP$,NN,IN,CD,NN"
For their troubles the banks get a larger captive audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate,"IN,PRP$,NNS,DT,NNS,VBP,DT,JJR,NN,NN,WDT,VBZ,RBR,JJ,TO,VB,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN"
The more accounts customers have Mr Sullivan says the more likely they are to be attracted to a package  and to be loyal to the bank that offers it,"DT,JJR,NNS,NNS,VBP,NNP,NNP,VBZ,DT,RBR,JJ,PRP,VBP,TO,VB,VBN,TO,DT,NN,CC,NN,TO,VB,JJ,TO,DT,NN,WDT,VBZ,PRP"

It's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive and make it pay Mr Jacob says,"PRP,RB,JJ,TO,VB,RP,NN,RB,JJ,CC,VB,PRP,VB,NNP,NNP,VBZ"
Still bankers expect packaging to flourish primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs,"RB,NNS,VBP,NN,TO,VB,RB,IN,JJR,NNS,VBP,VBG,IN,JJ,NNS,VB,VBN,TO,PRP$,NNS"

Like healthy regulatory capital,"IN,JJ,JJ,NN"

The Chicago Merc said a new onehour price limit would take effect in its Standard & Poor's 500 stockindex futures pit once S&P 500 futures fell 20 index points  the equivalent of about a 150point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average,"DT,NNP,NNP,VBD,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,NN,MD,VB,NN,IN,PRP$,NNP,CC,NNP,CD,NN,NNS,NN,RB,NNP,CD,NNS,VBD,CD,NN,NNS,CC,DT,NN,IN,RB,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP"
If the 20point limit is triggered after 130 pm Chicago time it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at 315 pm,"IN,DT,JJ,NN,VBZ,VBN,IN,CD,RB,NNP,NN,PRP,MD,VB,IN,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,VBG,IN,CD,RB"

The exchange said it decided a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stockindex futures on Friday Oct 13 when the Dow Jones industrials plunged 190 points and stockindex futures prices skidded as well,"DT,NN,VBD,PRP,VBD,DT,JJ,NN,NN,VBD,VBN,VBG,DT,NN,IN,DT,JJ,VBG,IN,NNS,CC,JJ,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP,CD,WRB,DT,NNP,NNP,NNS,VBD,CD,NNS,CC,JJ,NNS,NNS,VBD,RB,RB"

But when the contract reopened the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the 30point limit indicated that the intermediate limit of 20 points was needed to help keep stock and stockindex futures prices synchronized,"CC,WRB,DT,NN,VBD,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NN,NNS,WDT,RB,VBD,DT,NN,RP,TO,DT,JJ,NN,VBD,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,CD,NNS,VBD,VBN,TO,VB,VB,NN,CC,JJ,NNS,NNS,VBN"
Several traders maintained that the Merc's 12point circuitbreaker aggravated the market slide Oct 13 by directing additional selling pressure to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange,"JJ,NNS,VBD,IN,DT,NNP,JJ,NN,VBD,DT,NN,NN,NNP,CD,IN,VBG,JJ,VBG,NN,TO,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP"
All of the changes require regulatory approval which is expected shortly,"DT,IN,DT,NNS,VBP,JJ,NN,WDT,VBZ,VBN,RB"
The exchange also said that the 30point circuit breaker which currently provides only a onehour respite during market selloffs will become the maximum oneday limit for the S&P 500 stockindex futures contract; the oneday limit now is 50 index points,"DT,NN,RB,VBD,IN,DT,JJ,NN,NN,WDT,RB,VBZ,RB,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NN,NNS,MD,VB,DT,NN,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NNP,CD,JJ,NNS,NN,DT,JJ,NN,RB,VBZ,CD,NN,NNS"
A final modification was made to the fivepoint opening limit for the contract,"DT,JJ,NN,VBD,VBN,TO,DT,JJ,VBG,NN,IN,DT,NN"
The Merc said that fivepoint limit will remain in effect for the first 10 minutes of trading,"DT,NNP,VBD,DT,JJ,NN,MD,VB,IN,NN,IN,DT,JJ,CD,NNS,IN,NN"

In a posthearing news conference Mr Phelan who has publicly expressed concern about market volatility said he told the House finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the programtrading halt proposal providing the SEC would be comfortable with the language in a bill,"IN,DT,JJ,NN,NN,NNP,NNP,WP,VBZ,RB,VBN,NN,IN,NN,NN,VBD,PRP,VBD,DT,NNP,NN,CC,NNS,NN,IN,PRP,MD,VB,DT,JJ,NN,NN,VBG,DT,NNP,MD,VB,JJ,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN"

Mr Phelan said the Big Board is likely to study the programtrading issue,"NNP,NNP,VBD,DT,NNP,NNP,VBZ,JJ,TO,VB,DT,JJ,NN"
That response annoyed Rep Markey House aides said and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter,"DT,NN,VBD,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNS,VBD,CC,DT,NN,VBD,RP,IN,EX,VBD,VBN,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NN,CC,IN,PRP,VBD,NN,IN,NN,IN,DT,NN"
Fifteen of the 26 subcommittee members attended the hearing most notably Rep John Dingell LRB D Mich RRB the full House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman who has been willing to let Mr Markey carry the legislation in recent months,"CD,IN,DT,CD,NN,NNS,VBD,DT,NN,RBS,RB,NNP,NNP,NNP,RBR,NNP,NNP,RBR,DT,JJ,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP,NN,WP,VBZ,VBN,JJ,TO,VB,NNP,NNP,VB,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS"
Mr Dingell expressed concern sources said about jurisdictional problems in regulating program trading which uses futures to offset stock trades,"NNP,NNP,VBD,NN,NNS,VBD,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,VBG,NN,NN,WDT,VBZ,NNS,TO,VB,NN,NNS"

ASLACTON England,"NNP,NNP"
 Of all scenes that evoke rural England this is one of the loveliest An ancient stone church stands amid the fields the sound of bells cascading from its tower calling the faithful to evensong,"CC,IN,DT,NNS,WDT,VBP,JJ,NNP,DT,VBZ,CD,IN,DT,JJS,DT,JJ,NN,NN,VBZ,IN,DT,NNS,DT,NN,IN,NNS,VBG,IN,PRP$,NN,VBG,DT,NN,TO,NN"
The parishioners of St Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door as members here always have,"DT,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,DT,NNPS,VBP,TO,VB,IN,DT,NN,NN,IN,NNS,RB,RB,VBP"
In the tower five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614,"IN,DT,NN,CD,NNS,CC,NNS,VBP,RB,IN,NNS,VBN,TO,DT,JJ,CD,NNS,WDT,RB,VBD,RB,IN,CD"
But there is also a discordant modern note in Aslacton though it can't be heard by the churchgoers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening,"CC,EX,VBZ,RB,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,IN,NNP,IN,PRP,MD,VB,VBN,IN,DT,NNS,VBG,DT,NN,IN,NNS,DT,JJ,NN,NN"
Like most of the other 6000 churches in Britain with sets of bells St Michael once had its own band of ringers who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service,"IN,JJS,IN,DT,JJ,CD,NNS,IN,NNP,IN,NNS,IN,NNS,NNP,NNP,RB,VBD,PRP$,JJ,NN,IN,NNS,WP,MD,VB,DT,NNP,NN,CC,NN,NN"
Now only one local ringer remains 64yearold Derek Hammond,"RB,RB,CD,JJ,NN,VBZ,JJ,NNP,NNP"
The others here today live elsewhere,"DT,NNS,RB,NN,VBP,RB"
They belong to a group of 15 ringers  including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training  who drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimesexhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia,"PRP,VBP,TO,DT,NN,IN,CD,NNS,CC,VBG,CD,NNS,CC,CD,NNS,IN,NN,CC,WP,VBP,DT,NNP,IN,NN,TO,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,TO,VB,DT,NNS,VBG,IN,DT,JJ,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP"

Mr Hammond worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that keeps the Aslacton bells pealing,"NNP,NNP,VBZ,IN,JJ,NN,CC,DT,NN,IN,NN,MD,VB,DT,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,WDT,VBZ,DT,NNP,NNS,VBG"
History after all is not on his side,"NN,IN,DT,VBZ,RB,IN,PRP$,NN"
According to a nationwide survey taken a year ago nearly a third of England's church bells are no longer rung on Sundays because there is no one to ring them,"VBG,TO,DT,JJ,NN,VBN,DT,NN,RB,RB,DT,JJ,IN,NNP,NN,NNS,VBP,RB,RBR,VBN,IN,NNS,IN,EX,VBZ,DT,CD,TO,VB,PRP"
It is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes,"PRP,VBZ,JJ,TO,VB,WRB,DT,JJ,NN,VBZ,IN,DT,NNS"
The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells as do the carillons of continental Europe is considered by the English to be childish fit only for foreigners,"DT,RBR,JJ,NN,IN,VBG,NNS,IN,NNS,IN,VB,DT,NNS,IN,JJ,NNP,VBZ,VBN,IN,DT,NNP,TO,VB,JJ,JJ,RB,IN,NNS"
Changeringing a mindboggling exercise the English invented 380 years ago requires physical dexterity  some bells weigh more than a ton  combined with intense mental concentration,"NN,DT,JJ,NN,DT,NNP,VBD,CD,NNS,RB,VBZ,JJ,NN,CC,DT,NNS,VBP,JJR,IN,DT,NN,CC,VBN,IN,JJ,JJ,NN"
Proper English bells are started off in rounds from the highestpitched bell to the lowest  a simple descending scale using in larger churches as many as 12 bells,"JJ,JJ,NNS,VBP,VBN,RP,IN,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NN,TO,DT,JJS,CC,DT,JJ,VBG,NN,VBG,IN,JJR,NNS,RB,JJ,IN,CD,NNS"
Then at a signal the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking,"RB,IN,DT,NN,DT,NNS,VBP,VBG,DT,NN,IN,WDT,DT,NNS,VBP,IN,VBG,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,JJ"
Each variation or change can occur only once the rules state,"DT,NN,CC,NN,MD,VB,RB,RB,DT,NNS,VBP"
Ringers memorize patterns of changes known as methods which have oddsounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters,"NNS,VBP,NNS,IN,NNS,VBN,IN,NNS,WDT,VBP,JJ,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP"
A series of 5000 or so changes is a peal and takes about three hours,"DT,NN,IN,CD,CC,RB,NNS,VBZ,DT,NN,CC,VBZ,RB,CD,NNS"
A look at a Thursday night practice at St Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved,"DT,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NN,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NN,IN,NNP,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBN"
Ten shirtsleeved ringers stand in a circle one foot ahead of the other in a prizefighter's stance each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber,"CD,JJ,NNS,VBP,IN,DT,NN,CD,NN,RB,IN,DT,JJ,IN,DT,NN,NN,DT,VBG,DT,NN,WDT,VBZ,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN"
No one speaks and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves muffled by the ceiling,"DT,PRP,VBZ,CC,DT,VBG,IN,DT,NNS,VBZ,TO,VB,IN,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NNS,PRP,VBN,IN,DT,NN"
Totally absorbed the ringers stare straight ahead using peripheral vision LRB they call it ropesight RRB to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls,"RB,VBN,DT,NNS,VBP,RB,RB,VBG,JJ,NN,RBR,PRP,VBP,PRP,NN,RBR,TO,VB,DT,JJ,NNS,CC,RB,VB,PRP$,NNS"
Far above in the belfry the huge bronze bells mounted on wheels swing madly through a full 360 degrees starting and ending surprisingly in the inverted or mouthup position,"RB,RB,IN,DT,NN,DT,JJ,NN,NNS,VBN,IN,NNS,VBP,RB,IN,DT,JJ,CD,NNS,VBG,CC,VBG,RB,IN,DT,JJ,CC,JJ,NN"
Skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change,"JJ,NNS,VBP,PRP$,NNS,TO,VB,CC,VB,DT,JJ,NN,RB,IN,CD,NN,MD,VB,NNS,IN,DT,IN,DT,JJ,NN"
In a wellknown detectivestory involving church bells English novelist Dorothy L Sayers described ringing as a passion LCB that RCB finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection,"IN,DT,JJ,NN,VBG,NN,NNS,JJ,NN,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBD,VBG,IN,DT,NN,RBR,DT,RBR,VBZ,PRP$,NN,IN,JJ,NN,CC,JJ,NN"
Ringers she added are filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed,"NNS,PRP,VBD,VBP,VBN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,WDT,VBZ,IN,JJ,NN,RB,VBN"
Ringing does become a bit of an obsession admits Stephanie Pattenden master of the band at St Mary Abbot and one of England's best female ringers,"NN,VBZ,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,NNP,NNP,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,CC,CD,IN,NNP,JJS,NN,NNS"
It is a passion that usually stays in the tower however,"PRP,VBZ,DT,NN,WDT,RB,VBZ,IN,DT,NN,RB"
More often than not ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry,"RBR,RB,IN,RB,NNS,VBP,IN,DT,NN,IN,NN,VBD,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN"
When their changes are completed and after they have worked up a sweat ringers often skip off to the local pub leaving worship for others below,"WRB,PRP$,NNS,VBP,VBN,CC,IN,PRP,VBP,VBN,RP,DT,NN,NNS,RB,VBP,RP,TO,DT,JJ,NN,VBG,NN,IN,NNS,RB"
This does not sit well with some clerics,"DT,VBZ,RB,VB,RB,IN,DT,NNS"
With membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling strongwilled vicars are pressing equally strongwilled and often nonreligious ringers to attend services,"IN,NN,IN,DT,NNP,IN,NNP,RB,VBG,JJ,NNS,VBP,VBG,RB,JJ,CC,RB,JJ,NNS,TO,VB,NNS"
Two years ago the Rev Jeremy Hummerstone vicar of Great Torrington Devon got so fed up with ringers who didn't attend service he sacked the entire band; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest,"CD,NNS,RB,DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBD,RB,VBN,RP,IN,NNS,WP,VBD,VB,NN,PRP,VBD,DT,JJ,NN,DT,NNS,RB,VBN,RP,DT,NN,NN,IN,NN"
They were a selfperpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises the Vicar Hummerstone says,"PRP,VBD,DT,JJ,NN,WDT,VBD,DT,NN,IN,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,DT,NNP,NNP,VBZ"
An entirely new band rings today at Great Torrington several of whom are members of the congregation,"DT,RB,JJ,NN,VBZ,NN,IN,JJ,NNP,JJ,IN,WP,VBP,NNS,IN,DT,NN"
But there still aren't enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells,"CC,EX,RB,VBP,JJ,NNS,TO,VB,JJR,IN,CD,IN,DT,CD,NNS"
At St Mary's Church in Ilminster Somerset the bells have fallen silent following a dustup over church attendance,"IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,DT,NNS,VBP,VBN,JJ,VBG,DT,NN,IN,NN,NN"
The vicar WD Jones refuses to talk about it saying it would reopen the wound,"DT,NN,NNP,NNP,VBZ,TO,VB,IN,PRP,VBG,PRP,MD,VB,DT,NN"
But CJB Marshall vicar of a nearby church feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar,"CC,NNP,NNP,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,VBZ,DT,NN,VBZ,IN,DT,NNS,IN,DT,NN,NN,WDT,VBP,VBN,JJ,TO,DT,NN"
So crunch crunch crunch bang bang bang  here come the ringers from above making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer he says,"RB,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,CC,RB,VBP,DT,NNS,IN,RB,VBG,DT,RB,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,IN,NN,PRP,VBZ"
Vicar Marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue since he is both a vicar and an active bellringer himself,"NNP,NNP,VBZ,TO,VBN,NNS,IN,DT,NN,IN,PRP,VBZ,DT,DT,NN,CC,DT,JJ,NN,PRP"
The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church he says,"DT,NN,IN,NNS,VBZ,DT,NN,TO,VB,NNS,IN,DT,NN,PRP,VBZ"
I live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life,"PRP,VBP,IN,NNS,IN,DT,NNS,PRP,MD,VB,VBN,IN,DT,JJR,NN"
The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers a sort of parliament of ringing groups aims to improve relations with vicars says John C Baldwin president,"DT,NNP,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,DT,NN,IN,NN,IN,NN,NNS,VBZ,TO,VB,NNS,IN,NNS,VBZ,NNP,NNP,NNP,NN"
It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled The Bells in Your Care,"PRP,VBZ,TO,VB,TO,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NNS,IN,NN,NN,CC,MD,RB,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBD,DT,NNP,IN,PRP$,NNP"
Says Mr Baldwin We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience,"VBZ,NNP,NNP,PRP,VBP,IN,PRP,MD,RB,RBR,VBP,RB,JJ,DT,NN,IN,NN,NN,CC,NN"
Mr Baldwin is also attacking the greater problem lack of ringers,"NNP,NNP,VBZ,RB,VBG,DT,JJR,NN,NN,IN,NNS"
One survey says that of the 100000 trained bellringers in England today only 40000 of them still ring,"CD,NN,VBZ,IN,IN,DT,CD,VBN,NNS,IN,NNP,NN,RB,CD,IN,PRP,RB,VBP"
Also ringers don't always live where the bells need to be rung  like in small rural parishes and innercity churches,"RB,NNS,VBP,RB,VB,WRB,DT,NNS,VBP,TO,VB,VBN,CC,IN,IN,JJ,JJ,NNS,CC,NN,NNS"
But the council's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful says Mr Baldwin,"CC,DT,NN,NN,TO,VB,CC,VB,NNS,VBZ,RB,RB,JJ,VBZ,NNP,NNP"
Right now we're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10 he adds,"RB,RB,PRP,JJ,IN,IN,CD,NNS,PRP,VBP,CD,JJ,NN,IN,IN,CD,PRP,VBZ"
One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once maledominated field; more than a third of the ringers today are women,"CD,JJ,NN,VBZ,IN,DT,VBG,NN,IN,NNS,VBP,VBN,DT,RB,JJ,NN,JJR,IN,DT,JJ,IN,DT,NNS,NN,VBP,NNS"
They aren't accepted everywhere however,"PRP,VBP,VBN,RB,RB"
The oldest bellringing group in the country the Ancient Society of College Youths founded in 1637 remains maleonly a fact that's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain's most prestigious churches St Paul's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey,"DT,JJS,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,DT,NNP,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,VBN,IN,CD,VBZ,JJ,DT,NN,WDT,RB,JJ,TO,NNS,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NNS,IN,NNP,JJS,JJ,NNS,NNP,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP"
This being Britain no woman has filed an equalopportunity suit but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to The Ringing World a weekly newspaper for ringers,"DT,VBG,NNP,DT,NN,VBZ,VBN,DT,NN,NN,CC,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBD,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,NNS,TO,DT,NNP,NNP,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NNS"
One writer signing his letter as Redblooded balanced male remarked on the frequency of women fainting in peals and suggested that they settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings,"CD,NN,VBG,PRP$,NN,IN,JJ,JJ,NN,VBN,IN,DT,NN,IN,NNS,VBG,IN,NNS,CC,VBD,IN,PRP,VB,RB,IN,PRP$,JJ,NN,IN,VBG,NN,IN,NNS"
In the torrent of replies that followed one woman ringer from Solihull observed that the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired badly dressed decorated with acne and a large beerbelly frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals,"IN,DT,NN,IN,NNS,IN,VBD,CD,NN,NN,IN,NNP,VBN,IN,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,VBZ,RB,DT,NN,TO,VB,VBN,RB,VBN,VBN,IN,NN,CC,DT,JJ,NN,RB,JJ,CC,RB,JJ,IN,NNS"

Investors unsettled by the stock market's gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of quarterly dividend checks,"NNS,VBN,IN,DT,NN,NN,NNS,MD,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,JJ,NN,NNS"
That has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than 10,"DT,VBZ,VBN,RB,JJ,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,VBG,PRP$,NNS,JJR,IN,CD"
But don't breathe too easy Those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices some analysts warn,"CC,VBP,VB,RB,JJ,DT,NN,NNS,MD,VB,NN,RB,IN,NN,NNS,DT,NNS,VBP"
In the past they say the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stockmarket party was almost over,"IN,DT,NN,PRP,VBP,DT,JJS,NN,NN,VBZ,RB,VBN,IN,NNS,WRB,DT,NN,NN,VBD,RB,JJ"
That can be a trap for unwary investors says Richard Bernstein senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co,"DT,MD,VB,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,VBZ,NNP,NNP,JJ,JJ,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP"
Strong dividend growth he says is the black widow of valuation  a reference to the female spiders that attract males and then kill them after mating,"JJ,NN,NN,PRP,VBZ,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NN,CC,DT,NN,TO,DT,JJ,NNS,WDT,VBP,NNS,CC,RB,VBP,PRP,IN,VBG"
Stephen Boesel president of T Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund explains that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time,"NNP,NNP,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP,VBZ,IN,NNS,VBP,PRP$,NNS,RBS,RB,RB,IN,DT,NN,CC,JJ,NNS,VBP,VBN,VBG,IN,DT,NN"
Invariably those strong periods in the economy give way to recessionary environments he says,"RB,DT,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NN,VBP,NN,TO,JJ,NNS,PRP,VBZ"
And recessionary environments aren't hospitable to the stock market,"CC,JJ,NNS,VBP,JJ,TO,DT,NN,NN"
Indeed analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical peaks,"RB,NNS,VBP,IN,NNS,VBP,RB,VBN,RBS,RB,WRB,NNS,VBD,RB,IN,PRP$,NN,IN,IN,JJ,NNS"
In 1976 for example dividends on the stocks in Standard & Poor's 500stock index soared 10 following much slower growth the year before,"IN,CD,IN,NN,NNS,IN,DT,NNS,IN,NNP,CC,NNP,JJ,NN,VBD,CD,VBG,RB,JJR,NN,DT,NN,IN"
The S&P index started sliding in price in September 1976 and fell 12 in 1977  despite a 15 expansion in dividends that year,"DT,NNP,NN,VBD,VBG,IN,NN,IN,NNP,CD,CC,VBD,CD,IN,CD,CC,IN,DT,CD,NN,IN,NNS,DT,NN"
That pattern hasn't always held but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious,"DT,NN,VBZ,RB,VBN,CC,JJ,JJ,NN,IN,NNS,VBZ,DT,NN,NNS,JJ"
Payouts on the S&P 500 stocks rose 10 in 1988 according to Standard & Poor's Corp and Wall Street estimates for 1989 growth are generally between 9 and 14,"NNS,IN,DT,NNP,CD,NNS,VBD,CD,IN,CD,VBG,TO,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP,NNS,IN,CD,NN,VBP,RB,IN,CD,CC,CD"
Many people believe the growth in dividends will slow next year although a minority see doubledigit gains continuing,"JJ,NNS,VBP,DT,NN,IN,NNS,MD,VB,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBP,JJ,NNS,VBG"
Meanwhile many market watchers say recent dividend trends raise another warning flag While dividends have risen smartly their expansion hasn't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices,"RB,JJ,NN,NNS,VBP,JJ,NN,NNS,VBP,DT,NN,NN,IN,NNS,VBP,VBN,RB,PRP$,NN,VBZ,VBD,NN,IN,JJ,JJR,NNS,IN,NN,NNS"
As a result the market's dividend yield  dividends as a percentage of price  has slid to a level that is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards,"IN,DT,NN,DT,NN,NN,NN,CC,NNS,IN,DT,NN,IN,NN,CC,VBP,VBD,TO,DT,NN,WDT,VBZ,RB,JJ,CC,JJ,IN,JJ,NNS"
Put another way the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay some market analysts say,"VBN,DT,NN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,NNS,VBP,VBN,RB,JJ,IN,NN,JJ,TO,DT,NNS,PRP,VBP,DT,NN,NNS,VBP"
They are keeping a close watch on the yield on the S&P 500,"PRP,VBP,VBG,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNP,CD"
The figure is currently about 33 up from 32 before the recent market slide,"DT,NN,VBZ,RB,RB,CD,IN,IN,CD,IN,DT,JJ,NN,NN"
Some analysts say investors should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below 3,"DT,NNS,VBP,NNS,MD,VB,IN,DT,NNS,IN,DT,VBN,NN,NN,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,CD"
A drop below that 3 benchmark has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued says Mr Boesel of T Rowe Price,"DT,NN,IN,DT,CD,NN,VBZ,RB,VBN,DT,JJ,NN,NN,IN,NNS,VBP,RB,VBN,VBZ,NNP,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP"
In fact the market has always tanked,"IN,NN,DT,NN,VBZ,RB,VBN"

There's never been an exception says Gerald W Perritt a Chicago investment adviser and money manager based on a review of six decades of stockmarket data,"EX,RB,VBN,DT,NN,VBZ,NNP,NNP,NNP,DT,NNP,NN,NN,CC,NN,NN,VBN,IN,DT,NN,IN,CD,NNS,IN,NN,NN"
The last time the S&P 500 yield dropped below 3 was in the summer of 1987,"DT,JJ,NN,DT,NNP,CD,NN,VBD,IN,CD,VBD,IN,DT,NN,IN,CD"
Stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the October debacle,"NNS,WP,VBD,DT,NN,CC,VBD,NNS,VBD,DT,NNP,NN"
There have been only seven other times  in 1929 1933 1961 1965 1968 1971 and 1972  when the yield on the S&P 500 dropped below 3 for at least two consecutive months Mr Perritt found,"EX,VBP,VBN,RB,CD,JJ,NNS,CC,NN,CD,CD,CD,CD,CD,CD,CC,CD,CC,WRB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNP,CD,VBD,IN,CD,IN,IN,JJS,CD,JJ,NNS,NNP,NNP,VBD"
And in each case he says a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year,"CC,IN,DT,NN,PRP,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NN,NNS,VBD,IN,DT,NN"
Still some market analysts say the current 33 reading isn't as troublesome as it might have been in years past,"RB,DT,NN,NNS,VBP,DT,JJ,CD,NN,VBZ,RB,JJ,IN,PRP,MD,VB,VBN,IN,NNS,NN"
It's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner says James H Coxon head of stock investments for Cigna Corp the Philadelphiabased insurer,"PRP,RB,DT,RB,JJ,NN,RB,IN,NNS,VBP,RB,VBG,IN,DT,JJ,NN,VBZ,NNP,NNP,NNP,NN,IN,NN,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP,DT,JJ,NN"
In particular Mr Coxon says businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically,"IN,JJ,NNP,NNP,VBZ,NNS,VBP,VBG,RP,DT,JJR,NN,IN,PRP$,NNS,CC,NN,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,NNS,IN,PRP,VBP,RB"

In other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns  the environment the firm expects in 1990  the change in dividends ranged from a gain of 4 to a decline of 1 according to PaineWebber analyst Thomas Doerflinger,"IN,JJ,NNS,IN,WDT,EX,VBP,VBN,JJ,JJ,NNS,CC,JJ,NN,DT,NN,VBZ,IN,CD,CC,JJ,NN,IN,NNS,VBD,IN,DT,NN,IN,CD,TO,DT,NN,IN,CD,VBG,TO,NNP,NN,NNP,NNP"

That followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the yearearlier pace,"DT,VBD,CD,JJ,NNS,IN,WDT,DT,NN,IN,NNS,VBD,DT,JJ,NN"
While the S&P tally doesn't measure the magnitude of dividend changes a further slippage in the number of dividend increases could be a harbinger of slower dividend growth next year,"IN,DT,NNP,NN,VBZ,VB,DT,NN,IN,NN,NNS,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,NN,NNS,MD,VB,DT,NN,IN,JJR,NN,NN,IN,NN"

But regulators are wary,"CC,NNS,VBP,JJ"
They haven't forgotten the leap in share prices last Dec 7 when the first bout of foreignled index arbitrage drove stocks skyward in the last halfhour of trading startling regulators who thought they had written enough rules to prevent such a swing,"PRP,VBP,VBN,DT,NN,IN,NN,NNS,JJ,NNP,CD,WRB,DT,JJ,NN,IN,JJ,NN,NN,VBD,NNS,RB,IN,DT,JJ,JJ,IN,NN,JJ,NNS,WP,VBD,PRP,VBD,VBN,JJ,NNS,TO,VB,PDT,DT,NN"
Japan's Finance Ministry had set up mechanisms to limit how far futures prices could fall in a single session and to give market operators the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time,"NNP,NNP,NNP,VBD,VBN,RP,NNS,TO,VB,WRB,JJ,NNS,NNS,MD,VB,IN,DT,JJ,NN,CC,TO,VB,NN,NNS,DT,NN,TO,VB,NN,IN,NNS,IN,DT,NN"
Maybe it wasn't enough a Finance Ministry official noted after the Dec 7 surge,"RB,PRP,VBD,RB,DT,NNP,NNP,NN,VBD,IN,DT,NNP,CD,NN"

In addition to the extra privacy of these trades the transactions can often be less expensive to execute because the parties don't have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist's fee,"IN,NN,TO,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NNS,DT,NNS,MD,RB,VB,RBR,JJ,TO,VB,IN,DT,NNS,VBP,VB,TO,VB,DT,NN,NN,NN,CC,DT,NN,NN"

Both contracts have gained a following since the 1987 global market crash,"DT,NNS,VBP,VBN,DT,NN,IN,DT,CD,JJ,NN,NN"

The House voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early 1981 casting a solid 38237 vote for a compromise measure backed by President Bush,"DT,NNP,VBD,TO,VB,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,JJ,CD,VBG,DT,JJ,CD,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,VBN,IN,NNP,NNP"
The vote came after a debate replete with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor,"DT,NN,VBD,IN,DT,NN,JJ,IN,NNS,IN,DT,NNS,CC,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN"
Advocates said the 90centanhour rise to 425 an hour by April 1991 is too small for the working poor while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs,"NNS,VBD,DT,JJ,NN,TO,CD,DT,NN,IN,NNP,CD,VBZ,RB,JJ,IN,DT,VBG,NN,IN,NNS,VBD,IN,DT,NN,MD,RB,VB,JJ,NN,CC,VB,JJ,NNS,IN,NNS"
But the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on Tuesday by President Bush and Democratic leaders in Congress after congressional Republicans urged the White House to bend a bit from its previous resistance to compromise,"CC,DT,NN,VBD,DT,NN,VBN,TO,IN,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,JJ,NNS,IN,NNP,IN,JJ,NNPS,VBD,DT,NNP,NNP,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,PRP$,JJ,NN,TO,VB"
So both sides accepted the compromise which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a fouryear law was enacted in 1977 raising the wage to 335 an hour from 265,"IN,DT,NNS,VBD,DT,NN,WDT,MD,VB,TO,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,VBD,VBN,IN,CD,VBG,DT,NN,TO,CD,DT,NN,IN,CD"
Under the measure passed yesterday the minimum wage would rise to 380 next April,"IN,DT,NN,VBD,NN,DT,JJ,NN,MD,VB,TO,CD,JJ,NNP"
The Senate plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it,"DT,NNP,VBZ,TO,VB,RP,DT,NN,RB,CC,VBZ,VBN,TO,VB,PRP"
There are no smiles about this bill Rep Pat Williams LRB D Mont RRB said during House floor debate yesterday,"EX,VBP,DT,NNS,IN,DT,NN,NNP,NNP,NNP,RBR,NNP,NNP,RBR,VBD,IN,NNP,NN,NN,NN"
But because it's all we 've got I'm going to vote for it,"CC,IN,PRP,DT,PRP,VBP,VBN,PRP,VBG,TO,VB,IN,PRP"
While the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average US manufacturing wage the level of 425 an hour in 1991 will still be less than 35 of average factory pay Mr Williams said,"IN,DT,JJ,NN,VBD,RB,VBN,VBN,IN,PDT,DT,JJ,NNP,NN,NN,DT,NN,IN,CD,DT,NN,IN,CD,MD,RB,VB,JJR,IN,CD,IN,JJ,NN,NN,NNP,NNP,VBD"
But Rep Marge Roukema LRB R NJ RRB instead praised the House's acceptance of a new youth training wage a subminimum that GOP administrations have sought for many years,"CC,NNP,NNP,NNP,RBR,NNP,NNP,RBR,RB,VBD,DT,NNP,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,NN,NN,DT,NN,IN,NNP,NNS,VBP,VBN,IN,JJ,NNS"
Adopting a trainingwage policy means getting beyond the nickel and diming of the minimum wage Mrs Roukema said,"VBG,DT,JJ,NN,VBZ,VBG,IN,DT,NN,CC,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,NNP,NNP,VBD"
Policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage but they have lately touted it as necessary to help impart job skills to entrants into the work force,"NN,NNS,VBP,DT,NN,NN,IN,VBG,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,NNS,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,CC,PRP,VBP,RB,VBN,PRP,RB,JJ,TO,VB,VB,NN,NNS,TO,NNS,IN,DT,NN,NN"
Labor unions and Democrats long fought the idea but recently acceded to it in the face of Bush administration insistence,"NN,NNS,CC,NNPS,RB,VBD,DT,NN,CC,RB,VBD,TO,PRP,IN,DT,NN,IN,NNP,NN,NN"
The compromise sets the training wage at 335 an hour next April and at 361 an hour or 85 of the minimum wage in April 1991,"DT,NN,VBZ,DT,NN,NN,IN,CD,DT,NN,IN,NNP,CC,IN,CD,DT,NN,CC,CD,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NNP,CD"
Employers can pay the subminimum for 90 days without restriction to workers with less than six months of job experience and for another 90 days if the company uses a governmentcertified training program for the young workers,"NNS,MD,VB,DT,NN,IN,CD,NNS,IN,NN,TO,NNS,IN,JJR,IN,CD,NNS,IN,NN,NN,CC,IN,DT,CD,NNS,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NNS"
The training wage covers only workers who are 16 to 19 years old,"DT,NN,NN,VBZ,JJ,NNS,WP,VBP,CD,TO,CD,NNS,JJ"
The White House previously insisted on an unrestricted sixmonth training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job,"DT,NNP,NNP,RB,VBD,IN,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,NN,WDT,MD,VB,VBN,DT,NN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBD,DT,JJ,NN"
The US Chamber of Commerce still opposed to any mininumwage increase said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor 27 in two stages between April 1990 and April 1991 will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for American workers and higher prices for American consumers,"DT,NNP,NNP,IN,NNP,RB,VBN,TO,DT,NN,NN,VBD,DT,NN,NN,TO,VB,DT,NN,NN,CD,IN,CD,NNS,IN,NNP,CD,CC,NNP,CD,MD,VB,JJ,IN,JJ,NNS,TO,VB,CC,MD,VB,IN,DT,NN,IN,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,CC,JJR,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS"

For six years T Marshall Hahn Jr has made corporate acquisitions in the George Bush mode kind and gentle,"IN,CD,NNS,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBZ,VBN,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,NN,JJ,CC,JJ"
The question now Can he act more like hardcharging Teddy Roosevelt?,"DT,NN,RB,MD,PRP,VB,RBR,IN,JJ,NNP,NNP"
Mr Hahn the 62yearold chairman and chief executive officer of GeorgiaPacific Corp is leading the forestproduct concern's unsolicited 319 billion bid for Great Northern Nekoosa Corp,"NNP,NNP,DT,JJ,NN,CC,NN,JJ,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,VBZ,VBG,DT,NN,NN,JJ,CD,CD,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP"
Nekoosa has given the offer a public cold shoulder a reaction Mr Hahn hasn't faced in his 18 earlier acquisitions all of which were negotiated behind the scenes,"NNP,VBZ,VBN,DT,NN,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,DT,NN,NNP,NNP,VBZ,VBN,IN,PRP$,CD,JJR,NNS,DT,IN,WDT,VBD,VBN,IN,DT,NNS"
So far Mr Hahn is trying to entice Nekoosa into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough,"IN,RB,NNP,NNP,VBZ,VBG,TO,VB,NNP,IN,VBG,DT,JJ,NN,IN,VBG,JJ"
We are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction he says,"PRP,VBP,VBN,TO,VB,RB,NN,IN,DT,NN,PRP,VBZ"
But a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war with all that implies,"CC,DT,NN,NN,VBZ,RP,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,IN,DT,DT,VBZ"
If a competitor enters the game for example Mr Hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for Nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival,"IN,DT,NN,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,NN,NNP,NNP,MD,VB,DT,NN,IN,VBG,DT,NN,IN,NNP,CC,VBG,DT,NN,NN,IN,DT,NNS,IN,DT,NN"
Given that choice associates of Mr Hahn and industry observers say the former university president  who has developed a reputation for not overpaying for anything  would fold,"VBN,DT,NN,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,NN,NNS,VBP,DT,JJ,NN,NN,CC,WP,VBZ,VBN,DT,NN,IN,RB,VBG,IN,NN,CC,MD,VB"
There's a price above which I'm positive Marshall has the courage not to pay says AD Correll GeorgiaPacific's executive vice president for pulp and paper,"EX,DT,NN,IN,WDT,PRP,JJ,NNP,VBZ,DT,NN,RB,TO,VB,VBZ,NNP,NNP,NNP,JJ,NN,NN,IN,NN,CC,NN"
Says longtime associate Jerry Griffin vice president corporate development at WTD Industries Inc He isn't of the old school of winning at any cost,"VBZ,JJ,NN,NNP,NNP,NN,NN,JJ,NN,IN,NNP,NNPS,NNP,PRP,VBZ,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,VBG,IN,DT,NN"
He also is a consensus manager insiders say,"PRP,RB,VBZ,DT,NN,NN,NNS,VBP"
The decision to make the bid for Nekoosa for example was made only after all six members of GeorgiaPacific's management committee signed onto the deal  even though Mr Hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on says Mr Correll,"DT,NN,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,NNP,IN,NN,VBD,VBN,RB,IN,DT,CD,NNS,IN,NNP,NN,NN,VBD,IN,DT,NN,CC,RB,IN,NNP,NNP,VBD,PRP,VBD,TO,VB,IN,DT,NN,RB,IN,VBZ,NNP,NNP"
Associates say Mr Hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of Virginia Polytechnic Institute,"NNS,VBP,NNP,NNP,VBD,RP,DT,JJ,NN,TO,NN,IN,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP"
Assuming that post at the age of 35 he managed by consensus as is the rule in universities says Warren H Strother a university official who is researching a book on Mr Hahn,"VBG,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,CD,PRP,VBD,IN,NN,IN,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,NNS,VBZ,NNP,NNP,NNP,DT,NN,NN,WP,VBZ,VBG,DT,NN,IN,NNP,NNP"
But he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand,"CC,PRP,RB,VBD,DT,NN,TO,VB,DT,JJ,NN"
In 1970 Mr Hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were occupying a university building,"IN,CD,NNP,NNP,VBD,RP,NN,NNS,TO,VB,NN,NNS,WP,VBD,VBG,DT,NN,NN"
That impressed Robert B Pamplin GeorgiaPacific's chief executive at the time whom Mr Hahn had met while fundraising for the institute,"DT,VBN,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NN,JJ,IN,DT,NN,WP,NNP,NNP,VBD,VBN,IN,VBG,IN,DT,NN"
In 1975 Mr Pamplin enticed Mr Hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals; the move befuddled many in GeorgiaPacific who didn't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world,"IN,CD,NNP,NNP,VBD,NNP,NNP,IN,VBG,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NN,NN,IN,NN,IN,NNS,DT,NN,VBD,JJ,IN,NNP,WP,VBD,VB,DT,NN,NN,MD,VB,DT,NN,TO,DT,JJ,NN"
But Mr Hahn rose swiftly through the ranks demonstrating a raw intelligence that he says he knew he possessed early on,"CC,NNP,NNP,VBD,RB,IN,DT,NNS,VBG,DT,JJ,NN,IN,PRP,VBZ,PRP,VBD,PRP,VBD,RB,IN"
The son of a physicist Mr Hahn skipped first grade because his reading ability was so far above his classmates,"DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,NNP,NNP,VBD,JJ,NN,IN,PRP$,NN,NN,VBD,RB,RB,IN,PRP$,NNS"
Moving rapidly through school he graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Kentucky at age 18 after spending only 2 1/2 years in college,"VBG,RB,IN,NN,PRP,VBD,NNP,NNP,NNP,IN,DT,NNP,IN,NNP,IN,NN,CD,IN,VBG,RB,CD,CD,NNS,IN,NN"
He earned his doctorate in nuclear physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"PRP,VBD,PRP$,NN,IN,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,IN,NNP"
Mr Hahn agrees that he has a retentive memory but friends say that's an understatement,"NNP,NNP,VBZ,IN,PRP,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN,CC,NNS,VBP,DT,DT,NN"
They call it photographic,"PRP,VBP,PRP,JJ"
Mr Hahn also has engineered a surprising turnaround of GeorgiaPacific,"NNP,NNP,RB,VBZ,VBN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NNP"
Taking over as chief executive officer in 1983 he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a recessioninspired slide in its buildingproducts business,"VBG,RP,RB,NN,JJ,NN,IN,CD,PRP,VBD,DT,NN,WDT,VBD,VBN,IN,NN,CC,VBN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,PRP$,NNS,NN"
Mr Hahn began selling noncore businesses such as oil and gas and chemicals,"NNP,NNP,VBD,VBG,JJ,NNS,JJ,IN,NN,CC,NN,CC,NNS"
He even sold one unit that made vinyl checkbook covers,"PRP,RB,VBD,CD,NN,WDT,VBD,NN,NN,NNS"
At the same time he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while refocusing building products on home repair and remodeling rather than materials for newhome construction,"IN,DT,JJ,NN,PRP,VBD,VBG,RP,DT,NN,CC,NN,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,NN,NN,NNS,IN,NN,NN,CC,NN,RB,IN,NNS,IN,JJ,NN"
The idea was to buffet building products from cycles in newhome construction,"DT,NN,VBD,TO,VB,NN,NNS,IN,NNS,IN,JJ,NN"
The formula has paid off so far,"DT,NN,VBZ,VBN,RP,RB,RB"
GeorgiaPacific's sales climbed to 95 billion last year compared with 6 billion in 1983 when Mr Hahn took the reins,"NNP,NNS,VBD,TO,CD,CD,JJ,NN,VBN,IN,CD,CD,IN,CD,WRB,NNP,NNP,VBD,DT,NNS"
Profit from continuing operations has soared to 467 million from 75 million,"NN,IN,VBG,NNS,VBZ,VBN,TO,CD,CD,IN,CD,CD"
Mr Hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best,"NNP,NNP,VBZ,DT,NNS,TO,DT,NN,IN,VBG,IN,WP,DT,NN,VBZ,JJS"
The record of companies that have diversified isn't all that impressive he says,"DT,NN,IN,NNS,WDT,VBP,VBN,VBZ,DT,DT,JJ,PRP,VBZ"
Nekoosa wouldn't be a diversification,"NNP,MD,VB,DT,NN"
It would be a good match Mr Hahn and many analysts say of two healthy companies with highquality assets and strong cash flows,"PRP,MD,VB,DT,JJ,NN,NNP,NNP,CC,JJ,NNS,VBP,IN,CD,JJ,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,CC,JJ,NN,VBZ"
The resulting company would be the largest forestproducts concern in the world with combined sales of more than 13 billion,"DT,VBG,NN,MD,VB,DT,JJS,NNS,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,VBN,NNS,IN,JJR,IN,CD,CD"
But can Mr Hahn carry it off?,"CC,MD,NNP,NNP,VB,PRP,IN"
In this instance industry observers say he is entering uncharted waters,"IN,DT,NN,NN,NNS,VBP,PRP,VBZ,VBG,JJ,NNS"
Says Kathryn McAuley an analyst at First Manhattan Co This is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced,"VBZ,NNP,NNP,DT,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,DT,VBZ,DT,JJS,NN,NN,PRP,VBZ,VBN"
A HouseSenate conference approved major portions of a package for more than 500 million in economic aid for Poland that relies heavily on 240 million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal 1990 in hopes of stimulating future trade and investment,"DT,NNP,NN,VBD,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NN,IN,JJR,IN,CD,CD,IN,JJ,NN,IN,NNP,WDT,VBZ,RB,IN,CD,CD,IN,NN,CC,NN,NNS,IN,JJ,CD,IN,NNS,IN,VBG,JJ,NN,CC,NN"
For the Agency for International Development appropriators approved 200 million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program and total loan guarantees for the Overseas Private Investment Corp are increased by 40 million over fiscal 1989 as part of the same Poland package,"IN,DT,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,NNS,VBD,CD,CD,IN,JJ,NN,NNS,IN,DT,VBN,NN,NN,NN,NN,CC,JJ,NN,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBP,VBN,IN,CD,CD,IN,JJ,CD,IN,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NNP,NN"
The conference approved at least 55 million in direct cash and development assistance as well and though no decision was made both sides are committed to adding more than 200 million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the Bush administration,"DT,NN,VBD,IN,JJS,CD,CD,IN,JJ,NN,CC,NN,NN,IN,RB,CC,IN,DT,NN,VBD,VBN,DT,NNS,VBP,VBN,TO,VBG,JJR,IN,CD,CD,IN,JJ,NN,NNS,CC,JJ,NNS,VBN,IN,DT,NNP,NN"
The agreement on Poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill which has already provoked veto threats by the White House and is sharply confined under this year's budget,"DT,NN,IN,NNP,VBZ,IN,DT,JJ,NNS,VBG,IN,DT,VBG,JJ,NN,NN,WDT,VBZ,RB,VBN,NN,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,CC,VBZ,RB,VBN,IN,DT,NN,NN"
These fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the Poland package and while more ambitious authorizing legislation is still pending the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on US aid to Eastern Europe,"DT,JJ,NNS,VBP,RB,DT,NN,IN,VBG,DT,NNP,NN,CC,IN,RBR,JJ,VBG,NN,VBZ,RB,VBG,DT,NNS,NN,IN,NN,MD,VB,RBR,JJ,IN,NNP,NN,TO,NNP,NNP"
To accommodate the additional cash assistance the House Appropriations Committee last week was required to reallocate an estimated 140 million from the Pentagon,"TO,VB,DT,JJ,NN,NN,DT,NNP,NNPS,NNP,JJ,NN,VBD,VBN,TO,VB,DT,VBN,CD,CD,IN,DT,NNP"
And though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant recent experience with a similar program in Central America indicates that it could take several years before the new Polish government can fully use the aid effectively,"CC,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,NNS,VBN,NN,VBZ,JJ,JJ,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,VBZ,IN,PRP,MD,VB,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,MD,RB,VB,DT,NN,RB"
The action on Poland came as the conference separately approved 220 million for international population planning activities an 11 increase over fiscal 1989,"DT,NN,IN,NNP,VBD,IN,DT,NN,RB,VBD,CD,CD,IN,JJ,NN,VBG,NNS,DT,CD,NN,IN,JJ,CD"
The House and Senate are divided over whether the United Nations Population Fund will receive any portion of these appropriations but the size of the increase is itself significant,"DT,NNP,CC,NNP,VBP,VBN,IN,IN,DT,NNP,NNPS,NNP,NNP,MD,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNS,CC,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,PRP,JJ"
In a second area of common concern the world environment an additional 15 million will be provided in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives related both to global warming and the plight of the African elephant,"IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,JJ,NN,DT,NN,NN,DT,JJ,CD,CD,MD,VB,VBN,IN,NN,NN,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,NNS,VBN,DT,TO,JJ,NN,CC,DT,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN"
The sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments running from an import exemption for a California airplane museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of Panama's quota of exports to the profitable US market,"DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NN,NNS,VBG,IN,DT,NN,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NN,NN,TO,DT,JJ,CC,JJ,NN,IN,NN,VBG,NNS,IN,DT,NN,IN,NNP,NN,IN,NNS,TO,DT,JJ,NNP,NN"
Panama was stripped of this right because of US differences with the Noriega regime but the Central American country would have received a quota of 30537 metric tons over a 21month period ending Sept 30 1990,"NNP,VBD,VBN,IN,DT,NN,IN,IN,NNP,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,NN,CC,DT,NNP,NNP,NN,MD,VB,VBN,DT,NN,IN,CD,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NN,VBG,NNP,CD,CD"
About a quarter of this share has already been reallocated according to the industry but the remaining 23403 tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current US price of 18 cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate,"IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,RB,VBN,VBN,VBG,TO,DT,NN,CC,DT,VBG,CD,NNS,VBP,RB,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NNP,NN,IN,CD,NNS,DT,NN,VBZ,RB,JJ,IN,DT,NN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN"
The potential sales are nearly 93 million and House Majority Whip William Gray LRB D Pa RRB began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to Englishspeaking countries of the Caribbean such as Jamaica and Barbados,"DT,JJ,NNS,VBP,RB,CD,CD,CC,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,RBR,NNP,NNP,RBR,VBD,DT,NN,DT,NN,IN,VBG,NN,IN,DT,NN,VB,VBN,TO,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,JJ,IN,NNP,CC,NNP"
Rep Jerry Lewis a conservative Californian added a provision of his own intended to assist Bolivia and the Senate then broadened the list further by including all countries in the US Caribbean Basin initiate as well as the Philippines  backed by the powerful Hawaii Democrat Sen Daniel Inouye,"NNP,NNP,NNP,DT,JJ,NN,VBD,DT,NN,IN,PRP$,JJ,VBN,TO,VB,NNP,CC,DT,NNP,RB,VBD,DT,NN,RB,IN,VBG,DT,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,NN,RB,RB,IN,DT,NNP,CC,VBN,IN,DT,JJ,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP"
Jamaica wary of upsetting its Caribbean Basin allies has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by Mr Gray but the greater question is whether Mr Inouye who has strong ties to the sugar industry is able to insert a claim by the Philippines,"NNP,JJ,IN,VBG,PRP$,NNP,NNP,NNS,VBZ,RB,VBN,PRP$,NN,TO,VB,DT,NN,RB,VBN,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,DT,JJR,NN,VBZ,IN,NNP,NNP,WP,VBZ,JJ,NNS,TO,DT,NN,NN,VBZ,JJ,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNPS"

Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said The magnitude of these penalties and citations is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate indifference to worker safety and health and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards,"NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBD,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNS,CC,NNS,VBZ,VBN,RB,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNS,TO,NNS,WDT,VBD,IN,JJ,NN,TO,NN,NN,CC,NN,CC,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NN,CC,NN,NNS,VBN,TO,VB,DT,NNS"

The purpose of the bill is to put the brakes on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would impede safety or a carrier's ability to compete Rep John Paul Hammerschmidt LRB R Ark RRB said,"DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,TO,VB,DT,NNS,IN,NN,NNS,WDT,MD,RB,VB,DT,NN,RP,IN,NN,IN,PRP,MD,VB,NN,CC,DT,NN,NN,TO,VB,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,RBR,NNP,NNP,RBR,VBD"
The bill as it was approved by the House Public Works and Transportation Committee would give the Transportation Department up to 50 days to review any purchase of 15 or more of the stock in an airline,"DT,NN,IN,PRP,VBD,VBN,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,NNPS,CC,NNP,NNP,MD,VB,DT,NNP,NNP,IN,TO,CD,NNS,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,CD,CC,JJR,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN"
The department would be required to block the buyout if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be impaired; its ability to compete would be sharply diminished; it would be put into foreign control; or if the transaction would result in the sale of airlinerelated assets  unless selling such assets had an overriding public benefit,"DT,NN,MD,VB,VBN,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,JJ,TO,RB,VB,DT,NN,IN,IN,NN,MD,VB,VBN,PRP$,NN,TO,VB,MD,VB,RB,VBN,PRP,MD,VB,VBN,IN,JJ,NN,CC,IN,DT,NN,MD,VB,IN,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,CC,IN,VBG,JJ,NNS,VBD,DT,VBG,NN,NN"
The House approved an amendment offered by Rep Peter DeFazio LRB D Ore RRB that would in addition to the previous criteria also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier's employees or their wages or benefits,"DT,NNP,VBD,DT,NN,VBN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,RBR,NNP,NNP,RBR,WDT,MD,IN,NN,TO,DT,JJ,NNS,RB,VB,DT,NN,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,VBN,NN,VBN,VBD,JJ,TO,VB,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,NNS,CC,PRP$,NNS,CC,NNS"
Rep James Traficant LRB D Ohio RRB said the amendment which passed 271147 would let the American worker know that we consider them occasionally,"NNP,NNP,NNP,RBR,NNP,NNP,RBR,VBD,DT,NN,WDT,VBD,CD,MD,VB,DT,JJ,NN,VB,IN,PRP,VBP,PRP,RB"
But Rep Hammerschmidt said that the provision which he dubbed a special interest amendment was likely to make the bill even more controversial,"CC,NNP,NNP,VBD,IN,DT,NN,WDT,PRP,VBD,DT,JJ,NN,NN,VBD,JJ,TO,VB,DT,NN,RB,RBR,JJ"
On Tuesday the House approved a laborbacked amendment that would require the Transportation Department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code,"IN,NNP,DT,NNP,VBD,DT,JJ,NN,WDT,MD,VB,DT,NNP,NNP,TO,VB,NN,NNS,IN,DT,NN,VBG,TO,VB,DT,NN,VBD,VBN,CD,CC,JJR,NNS,RB,WDT,VBP,VBN,IN,NN,IN,NNS,IN,NN,CD,IN,DT,JJ,NNP,NNP"
The provision called the twotimelosers amendment by its supporters apparently was aimed at preventing Texas Air Corp Chairman Frank Lorenzo from attempting to take over another airline,"DT,NN,VBN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,PRP$,NNS,RB,VBD,VBN,IN,VBG,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,IN,VBG,TO,VB,RP,DT,NN"
Followup report,"JJ,NN"
You now may drop by the Voice of America offices in Washington and read the text of what the Voice is broadcasting to those 130 million people around the world who tune in to it each week,"PRP,RB,MD,VB,IN,DT,NNP,IN,NNP,NNS,IN,NNP,CC,VB,DT,NN,IN,WP,DT,NNP,VBZ,VBG,TO,DT,CD,CD,NNS,IN,DT,NN,WP,VBP,RP,TO,PRP,DT,NN"
You can even take notes  extensive notes for the Voice folks won't look over your shoulder  about what you read,"PRP,MD,RB,VB,NNS,CC,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,NNS,MD,VB,IN,PRP$,NN,CC,IN,WP,PRP,VBP"
You can do all this even if you're not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of Congress,"PRP,MD,VB,PDT,DT,RB,IN,PRP,RB,DT,NN,CC,DT,NN,CC,DT,NN,CC,DT,NN,IN,NNP"
And my newspaper can print the text of those broadcasts,"CC,PRP$,NN,MD,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNS"
Until the other day you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy had no right to see what your government was telling your cousins around the world,"IN,DT,JJ,NN,PRP,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBD,DT,NN,TO,VB,WP,PRP$,NN,VBD,VBG,PRP$,NNS,IN,DT,NN"
That was the law,"DT,VBD,DT,NN"
And I apparently had no right to print hither what the Voice was booming to yon,"CC,PRP,RB,VBD,DT,NN,TO,VB,RB,WP,DT,NNP,VBD,VBG,TO,RB"
It was censorship,"PRP,VBD,NN"
It was outrageous,"PRP,VBD,JJ"
And it was stupid,"CC,PRP,VBD,JJ"
The theory was that the Voice is a propaganda agency and this government shouldn't propagandize its own people,"DT,NN,VBD,IN,DT,NNP,VBZ,DT,NN,NN,CC,DT,NN,MD,VB,PRP$,JJ,NNS"
That sounds neat but this government  any government  propagandizes its own people every day,"DT,VBZ,JJ,CC,DT,NN,CC,DT,NN,CC,VBZ,PRP$,JJ,NNS,DT,NN"
Government press releases speeches briefings tours of military facilities publications are all propaganda of sorts,"NNP,NN,NNS,NNS,NNS,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,NNS,VBP,DT,NN,IN,NNS"
Propaganda is just information to support a viewpoint and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue,"NN,VBZ,RB,NN,TO,VB,DT,NN,CC,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,IN,PRP,VBZ,PRP,TO,VB,CC,VB,DT,NN,CC,RB,VB,RP,PRP$,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN"
The restrictions on viewing and dissemination of Voice material were especially absurd An agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform,"DT,NNS,IN,VBG,CC,NN,IN,NNP,NN,VBD,RB,JJ,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,VBD,RB,VBG,VBN,TO,VB"
In June 1988 I wrote in this space about this issue,"IN,NNP,CD,PRP,VBD,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN"
Assuming it wasn't one of those columns that you clipped and put on the refrigerator door I 'll review the facts,"VBG,PRP,VBD,CD,IN,DT,NNS,IN,PRP,VBD,CC,VBD,IN,DT,NN,NN,PRP,MD,VB,DT,NNS"
The Voice of America is a government agency that broadcasts news and views  some might say propaganda  in 43 languages to 130 million listeners around the world,"DT,NNP,IN,NNP,VBZ,DT,NN,NN,WDT,VBZ,NN,CC,NNS,CC,DT,MD,VB,NN,CC,IN,CD,NNS,TO,CD,CD,NNS,IN,DT,NN"
It does a firstrate job,"PRP,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN"
Its budget 184 million  is paid for by you,"PRP$,NN,CD,CD,CC,VBZ,VBN,IN,IN,PRP"
But a 1948 law barred the dissemination of that material in the US,"CC,DT,CD,NN,VBD,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNP"
The law let scholars reporters and researchers read texts of VOA material only at VOA headquarters in Washington but it barred them from copying texts,"DT,NN,VBD,NNS,NNS,CC,NNS,VB,NNS,IN,NNP,NN,RB,IN,NNP,NNS,IN,NNP,CC,PRP,VBD,PRP,IN,VBG,NNS"
And of course there's that word dissemination,"CC,IN,NN,EX,DT,NN,NN"
How's that again?,"WRB,DT,RB"
You may come by the agency to read but not copy either manually or by photocopying a Voice official explained when I asked,"PRP,MD,VB,IN,DT,NN,TO,VB,CC,RB,VB,DT,RB,CC,IN,VBG,DT,NNP,NN,VBD,WRB,PRP,VBD"
What if I tune in my shortwave radio transcribe an editorial or program and print it in my newspaper?,"WP,IN,PRP,VBP,RP,PRP$,JJ,NN,VBP,DT,NN,CC,NN,CC,VBP,PRP,IN,PRP$,NN"
Nor are you free to reprint such material I was advised,"CC,VBP,PRP,JJ,TO,VB,JJ,NN,PRP,VBD,VBN"
That sounded a lot like censorship so after years of letters and conversations that went nowhere I sued,"WDT,VBD,DT,NN,IN,NN,RB,IN,NNS,IN,NNS,CC,NNS,WDT,VBD,RB,PRP,VBD"
A couple of weeks ago I lost the case in federal district court in Des Moines,"DT,NN,IN,NNS,IN,PRP,VBD,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NN,NN,IN,NNP,NNP"
At least that's the way it was reported,"IN,JJS,DT,DT,NN,PRP,VBD,VBN"
And indeed the lawsuit was dismissed,"CC,RB,DT,NN,VBD,VBN"
But I  I like to think of it in terms of we all of us  won the point,"CC,PRP,CC,PRP,VBP,TO,VB,IN,PRP,IN,NNS,IN,PRP,DT,IN,PRP,CC,VBD,DT,NN"
For a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling The United States Information Agency which runs the Voice changed its position on three key points,"IN,DT,JJ,NN,VBD,IN,DT,NN,TO,DT,NN,DT,NNP,NNPS,NNP,NNP,WDT,VBZ,DT,NNP,VBD,PRP$,NN,IN,CD,JJ,NNS"
 The USIA said that on reflection of course I could print anything I could get my hands on,"CC,DT,NNP,VBD,IN,IN,NN,IN,NN,PRP,MD,VB,NN,PRP,MD,VB,PRP$,NNS,IN"
The word dissemination it decided referred only to itself,"DT,NN,NN,PRP,VBD,VBD,RB,TO,PRP"
The USIA officially and publicly declared the absolute right of everyone except the USIA to disseminate agency program materials in the United States my lawyer the scholarly Mark McCormick of Des Moines said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that I had lost,"DT,NNP,RB,CC,RB,VBD,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NN,IN,DT,NNP,TO,VB,NN,NN,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,NNPS,PRP$,NN,DT,JJ,NNP,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,VBD,IN,DT,NN,VBG,RP,DT,NNS,CC,VBG,TO,VB,PRP,VB,JJ,IN,DT,NN,VBD,IN,PRP,VBD,VBN"
The court noted the new USIA position but just in case officially found that Congress did not intend to preclude plaintiffs from disseminating USIA information domestically,"DT,NN,VBD,DT,JJ,NNP,NN,CC,RB,IN,NN,RB,VBN,IN,NNP,VBD,RB,VB,TO,VB,NNS,IN,VBG,NNP,NN,RB"
 The USIA said that on reflection anyone could view the VOA materials not just the reporters scholars researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute,"CC,DT,NNP,VBD,IN,IN,NN,NN,MD,VB,DT,NNP,NNS,RB,RB,DT,NNS,NNS,NNS,CC,NNS,WP,VBP,VBN,IN,DT,NN"
The USIA publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed access to the materials notwithstanding the statutory designations because the USIA has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and requesting to see the materials Mr McCormick noted,"DT,NNP,RB,CC,RB,VBD,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNS,VBP,VBN,NN,TO,DT,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,VBZ,VBN,IN,PRP,MD,RB,VB,DT,NNS,IN,DT,NN,VBG,CC,VBG,TO,VB,DT,NNS,NNP,NNP,VBD"
 And the USIA said that all of us could take extensive notes,"CC,CC,DT,NNP,VBD,IN,DT,IN,PRP,MD,VB,JJ,NNS"
The agency publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that persons who examine the materials may make notes and while the agency position is that persons may not take verbatim notes no one will check to determine what notes a person has taken Mr McCormick reported,"DT,NN,RB,CC,RB,VBD,IN,DT,NN,IN,NNS,WP,VBP,DT,NNS,MD,VB,NNS,CC,IN,DT,NN,NN,VBZ,IN,NNS,MD,RB,VB,JJ,NNS,DT,NN,MD,VB,TO,VB,WDT,NNS,DT,NN,VBZ,VBN,NNP,NNP,VBD"
I had sought in my suit the right to print Voice material which had been denied me and I had sought a right to receive the information arguing in effect that a right to print government information isn't very helpful if I have no right to get the information,"PRP,VBD,VBN,IN,PRP$,NN,DT,NN,TO,VB,NNP,NN,WDT,VBD,VBN,VBN,PRP,CC,PRP,VBD,VBN,DT,NN,TO,VB,DT,NN,VBG,IN,NN,IN,DT,NN,TO,VB,NN,NN,VBZ,RB,JJ,IN,PRP,VBP,DT,NN,TO,VB,DT,NN"
But the court disagreed,"CC,DT,NN,VBD"
The First Amendment proscribes the government from passing laws abridging the right to free speech Judge Donald O'Brien ruled,"DT,NNP,NNP,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,VBG,NNS,VBG,DT,NN,TO,JJ,NN,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBD"
The First Amendment does not prescribe a duty upon the government to assure easy access to information for members of the press,"DT,NNP,NNP,VBZ,RB,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,TO,VB,JJ,NN,TO,NN,IN,NNS,IN,DT,NN"
So now the situation is this,"IN,RB,DT,NN,VBZ,DT"
You have a right to read Voice of America scripts if you don't mind traveling to Washington every week or so and visiting the Voice office during business hours,"PRP,VBP,DT,NN,TO,VB,NNP,IN,NNP,NNS,IN,PRP,VBP,VB,VBG,TO,NNP,DT,NN,CC,RB,CC,VBG,DT,NNP,NN,IN,NN,NNS"
I have a right to print those scripts if I go there and laboriously  but no longer surreptitiously  copy them out in long hand,"PRP,VBP,DT,NN,TO,VB,DT,NNS,IN,PRP,VBP,RB,CC,RB,CC,CC,RB,JJR,RB,CC,VBP,PRP,RP,IN,JJ,NN"
But neither of us can copy the material on a Xerox machine or have it sent to us,"CC,DT,IN,PRP,MD,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NN,CC,VB,PRP,VBN,TO,PRP"
In an era when every government agency has a publicrelations machine that sends you stuff whether you want it or not this does seem odd,"IN,DT,NN,WRB,DT,NN,NN,VBZ,DT,NNS,NN,WDT,VBZ,PRP,NN,IN,PRP,VBP,PRP,CC,RB,DT,VBZ,VB,JJ"
Indeed Judge O'Brien ruled that it would be easy to conclude that the USIA's position is inappropriate or even stupid ' but it's the law,"RB,NNP,NNP,VBD,IN,PRP,MD,VB,JJ,TO,VB,IN,DT,NNP,NN,VBZ,JJ,CC,RB,JJ,DT,CC,PRP,DT,NN"
So the next step I suspect is to try to get the law changed,"IN,DT,JJ,NN,PRP,VBP,VBZ,TO,VB,TO,VB,DT,NN,VBD"
We LRB I assume you're in this with me at this point RRB need to get three words  for examination only  eliminated from the law,"PRP,RBR,PRP,VBP,PRP,IN,DT,IN,PRP,IN,DT,NN,RBR,VBP,TO,VB,CD,NNS,CC,IN,NN,RB,CC,VBN,IN,DT,NN"
Section 501 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 says Voice material shall be available to certain of us LRB but now thanks to the USIA's new position all of us RRB for examination only,"NN,CD,IN,DT,NNP,NNPS,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP,NNP,IN,CD,VBZ,NNP,NN,MD,VB,JJ,TO,JJ,IN,PRP,RBR,CC,RB,NNS,TO,DT,NNP,JJ,NN,DT,IN,PRP,RBR,IN,NN,RB"
If those words weren't there the nice people at the Voice would be able to send you the information or at the very least let you photocopy it,"IN,DT,NNS,VBD,RB,DT,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,MD,VB,JJ,TO,VB,PRP,DT,NN,CC,IN,DT,RB,JJS,VB,PRP,VB,PRP"
This is not a trivial issue,"DT,VBZ,RB,DT,JJ,NN"
You have  raised important questions which ought to be answered What does USIA say about America abroad; how do we say it; and how can American taxpayers get the answers to these questions? a man wrote me a couple of years ago,"PRP,VBD,CC,VBN,JJ,NNS,WDT,MD,TO,VB,VBN,WP,VBZ,NNP,VB,IN,NNP,RB,WRB,VBP,PRP,VB,PRP,CC,WRB,MD,JJ,NNS,VB,DT,NNS,TO,DT,NNS,DT,NN,VBD,PRP,DT,NN,IN,NNS,IN"

Mr McGovern was widely seen as sales and not profit oriented,"NNP,NNP,VBD,RB,VBN,IN,NNS,CC,RB,NN,VBN"
New managers would think a little more like Wall Street Mr McMillin added,"JJ,NNS,MD,VB,DT,RB,JJR,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBD"
Some of the surge in the stock's price appeared to be linked to revived takeover speculation which has contributed to volatility of Campbell shares in recent months,"DT,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,VBD,TO,VB,VBN,TO,VBN,NN,NN,WDT,VBZ,VBN,TO,NN,IN,NNP,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS"
Campbell's international businesses particularly in the UK and Italy appear to be at the heart of its problems,"NNP,JJ,NNS,RB,IN,DT,NNP,CC,NNP,VBP,TO,VB,IN,DT,NN,IN,PRP$,NNS"

Sometimes you just go with your gut,"RB,PRP,RB,VBP,IN,PRP$,NN"

Mr Newhouse meanwhile insisted that he isn't unhappy with Mr Bernstein or the performance of Random House the largest trade publishing house in the US,"NNP,NNP,RB,VBD,IN,PRP,VBZ,JJ,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,DT,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,DT,JJS,NN,VBG,NN,IN,DT,NNP"

Mr Bernstein who succeeded Bennett Cerf has been only the second president of Random House since it was founded in 1925,"NNP,NNP,WP,VBD,NNP,NNP,VBZ,VBN,RB,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,IN,PRP,VBD,VBN,IN,CD"
Speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house,"NN,IN,PRP$,NN,VBZ,IN,DT,NN,IN,NN,NNS,IN,DT,NN"
Possible candidates include Susan Petersen president of Ballantine/Del Rey/Fawcett Random House's huge and successful paperback division,"JJ,NNS,VBP,NNP,NNP,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,JJ,CC,JJ,NN,NN"
Some say Anthony Cheetham head of a recently acquired British company Century Hutchinson could be chosen,"DT,VBP,NNP,NNP,NN,IN,DT,RB,VBN,JJ,NN,NNP,NNP,MD,VB,VBN"
There is also speculation that Mr Newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another Newhouse family member to run the business side in combination with a publishing executive like Robert Gottlieb who left Random House's Alfred A Knopf to run the New Yorker also owned by the Newhouse family,"EX,VBZ,RB,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,MD,VB,IN,DT,NN,NN,CC,DT,NNP,NN,NN,TO,VB,DT,NN,NN,IN,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,WP,VBD,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,TO,VB,DT,NNP,NNP,RB,VBN,IN,DT,NNP,NN"
Not included on the mostlikelysuccessor list are Joni Evans recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for Random House and Sonny Mehta president of the prestigious Alfred A Knopf unit,"RB,VBN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,VBP,NNP,NNP,VBN,CD,NNS,IN,TO,VB,NN,IN,NN,NN,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NNP,NNP,NNP,NN"
When Ms Evans took her job several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor weren't included partly because she didn't wish to be a fulltime administrator,"WRB,NNP,NNP,VBD,PRP,NN,JJ,JJ,NNS,WDT,VBD,VBN,TO,PRP$,NN,VBD,VBN,RB,IN,PRP,VBD,NN,TO,VB,DT,JJ,NN"

Mr Bernstein a tall energetic man who is widely respected as a publishing executive has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues,"NNP,NNP,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,WP,VBZ,RB,VBN,IN,DT,NN,NN,VBZ,VBN,JJ,IN,PRP$,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,NNS"
Congress learned during the Reagan administration that it could intimidate the executive branch by uttering again and again the same seven words Provided that no funds shall be spent ,"NNP,VBD,IN,DT,NNP,NN,IN,PRP,MD,VB,DT,JJ,NN,IN,VBG,RB,CC,RB,DT,JJ,CD,NNS,VBN,IN,DT,NNS,MD,VB,VBN,CC"
This phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through Congress,"DT,NN,RB,RB,VBZ,VBN,IN,DT,JJ,NNS,NNS,RB,VBG,IN,NNP"
It signals Congress's attempt under the pretext of guarding the public purse to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in Article II of the Constitution,"PRP,VBZ,NNP,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,VBG,DT,JJ,NN,TO,VB,DT,NN,DT,NN,JJ,TO,VB,JJ,IN,PRP$,NNS,CC,NNS,VBN,IN,NNP,NNP,IN,DT,NNP"
This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional,"DT,NN,IN,JJ,NN,VBZ,VBN,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNS,NN,WDT,VBZ,JJ,CC,JJ"
The appropriations clause states that No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law ,"DT,NNS,NN,VBZ,IN,DT,NN,MD,VB,VBN,IN,DT,NNP,CC,IN,NN,IN,NNS,VBN,IN,NN,CC"
The prevailing interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding,"DT,VBG,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,VBZ,IN,PRP,VBZ,NNP,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,TO,VB,NN"
This interpretation was officially endorsed by Congress in 1987 in the IranContra Report,"DT,NN,VBD,RB,VBN,IN,NNP,IN,CD,IN,DT,NNP,NNP"
As partisans of congressional power understand a power of the purse so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers,"IN,NNS,IN,JJ,NN,VBP,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,RB,RB,VBN,MD,VB,DT,NN,CC,VB,DT,NN,IN,NN,IN,NNS"
It is not supported by the text or history of the Constitution,"PRP,VBZ,RB,VBN,IN,DT,NN,CC,NN,IN,DT,NNP"
The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 according to Madison's notes,"DT,NNS,RB,VBD,DT,NNS,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,IN,CD,VBG,TO,NNP,NNS"
To the extent they did their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability,"TO,DT,NN,PRP,VBD,PRP$,NN,VBD,TO,VB,JJ,NN"
Moreover the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation,"RB,DT,NNS,VBD,IN,DT,NN,VBD,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,CC,NNS,TO,VB,DT,NN,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,VBD,VBN,RB,IN,DT,NNPS,IN,NNP"
It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause LRB technically a limitation on legislative power RRB could be read as placing the president on Congress's short leash making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress,"PRP,MD,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNS,NN,RBR,RB,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NN,RBR,MD,VB,VBN,IN,VBG,DT,NN,IN,NNP,JJ,NN,VBG,DT,NN,VBP,IN,DT,NN,CC,DT,NN,IN,NNP"
As it went to the conference panel now deliberating the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public's money,"IN,PRP,VBD,TO,DT,NN,NN,RB,VBG,DT,NNS,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,JJ,CD,VBD,DT,JJ,NNS,IN,NNP,TO,VB,DT,NNP,IN,DT,NN,IN,VBG,DT,NN,NN"
During the coming weeks President Bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them  or alternatively to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II and thus void and severable,"IN,DT,VBG,NNS,NNP,NNP,MD,VB,IN,TO,VB,DT,NNS,VBG,PRP,CC,CC,RB,TO,VB,DT,NNS,IN,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBG,PRP$,NNS,IN,JJ,NN,TO,VB,IN,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,RB,JJ,CC,JJ"
The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II,"DT,CD,NNS,NN,VBZ,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,PRP$,NNS,TO,VB,JJ,NNS,IN,VBN,IN,NNP,NNP"
Article II places on the president the duty to nominate and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate appoint ambassadors judges and other officers of the US,"NNP,NNP,VBZ,IN,DT,NN,DT,NN,TO,VB,CC,IN,CC,IN,DT,NNP,CC,NNP,IN,DT,NNP,VB,NNS,NNS,CC,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NNP"
It also empowers the president to make recess appointments without Senate approval The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session,"PRP,RB,VBZ,DT,NN,TO,VB,NN,NNS,IN,NNP,NN,DT,NNP,MD,VB,NN,TO,VB,RP,DT,NNS,WDT,MD,VB,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNP,IN,VBG,NNS,WDT,MD,VB,IN,DT,NN,IN,PRP$,JJ,NN"
Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person,"RB,NNP,CD,IN,DT,NNS,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,VBN,IN,DT,CC,DT,JJ,NN,MD,VB,VBN,TO,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,WDT,PRP,CC,PRP,VBZ,VBN,VBN,IN,DT,NNP,VBZ,VBN,RB,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,VBN,NN"
Thus with one brief passage in an appropriations bill Congress repeals the president's power to make recess appointments under Article II,"RB,IN,CD,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NNS,NN,NNP,VBZ,DT,NN,NN,TO,VB,NN,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP"
Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing,"NN,CD,RB,VBZ,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NN,NN,TO,VB,NNS,IN,PRP$,NN"
The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person's salary,"DT,NN,IN,DT,NNS,NN,VBZ,IN,DT,NN,TO,DT,NN,IN,DT,VBN,NN,MD,VB,IN,DT,NN,VBG,VBN,VBG,TO,VB,DT,NN,NN"
The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay because the AntiDeficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government,"DT,NN,MD,RB,RB,VB,DT,NN,IN,VBG,NNS,JJ,TO,VB,IN,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,VBZ,JJ,NN,TO,DT,NN"
The 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of muzzling provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution,"DT,CD,NNS,NNS,RB,VBP,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,WDT,VBP,DT,NN,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,IN,DT,NNP"
Muzzling provisions which might be called blindfold laws as well prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options let alone from recommending them to Congress,"JJ,NNS,WDT,MD,VB,VBN,NN,NNS,IN,RB,VBP,DT,JJ,NN,IN,RB,VBG,IN,JJ,NN,NNS,VB,RB,IN,VBG,PRP,TO,NNP"
Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations,"JJ,NNS,VBP,DT,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,WDT,VBZ,DT,NN,TO,VB,NNS,TO,NNP,CC,WDT,VBZ,DT,NN,DT,NN,TO,VB,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NNS"
Typically these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more marketoriented alternatives to regulations,"RB,DT,NNS,VBP,TO,VB,JJ,NN,NNS,IN,VBG,IN,IN,JJ,JJ,NNS,VBP,DT,JJ,NN,CC,VBG,JJR,JJ,NNS,TO,NNS"
Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any costbenefit scrutiny,"RB,DT,RBS,JJ,NN,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNS,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,WDT,VBZ,DT,NN,NNP,IN,NNP,CC,NNP,IN,VBG,JJ,NN,NNS,TO,DT,JJ,NN"
There is something inherently suspect about Congress's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other,"EX,VBZ,NN,RB,JJ,IN,NNP,VBG,DT,NN,IN,RB,VBG,IN,JJ,NNS,VBP,VBG,VBN,IN,DT,VBN,NN,CC,JJ"
Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executiveoffice bill None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement administer or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States,"RB,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NNS,VBN,IN,DT,NNS,NNS,IN,JJ,CD,RBR,VBZ,NNP,NN,TO,VB,JJ,NN,IN,NN,CD,IN,DT,NN,NN,NN,IN,DT,NNS,VBN,JJ,JJ,TO,DT,NNS,IN,DT,NN,MD,VB,VBN,TO,VB,VB,CC,VB,DT,NN,WDT,VBZ,VBN,VBN,JJ,TO,DT,NN,IN,NN,RB,VBN,IN,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NNPS"
This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president's execution of the law since a onehouse resolution could be said to be duly adopted even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto,"DT,NN,VBZ,TO,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,MD,VB,VBN,TO,VB,RB,VBN,RB,IN,PRP,MD,VB,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NNP,CC,NN,TO,DT,NN,IN,PRP$,NN,CC,NN"
The Supreme Court's decision in INS v Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional,"DT,NNP,NNP,NN,IN,NNP,CC,NNP,VBD,IN,JJ,NNS,VBP,JJ"
President Bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives,"NNP,NNP,MD,VB,NNS,NNS,WDT,VBP,DT,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NN,NN,TO,VB,PRP$,NNS,CC,VB,PRP$,NNS"
If President Bush fails to do so in his first year he will invite Congress for the remainder of his presidency to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes,"IN,NNP,NNP,VBZ,TO,VB,RB,IN,PRP$,JJ,NN,PRP,MD,VB,NNP,IN,DT,NN,IN,PRP$,NN,TO,VB,NNP,NNP,IN,DT,NNP,TO,VB,PRP$,NNS"
What becomes custom in the Bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents including Democrats to undo,"WP,VBZ,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NN,MD,RB,VB,RBR,JJ,IN,JJ,NNS,VBG,NNPS,TO,VB"
President Reagan learned that lesson,"NNP,NNP,VBD,DT,NN"
By 1987 thenSpeaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president through an appropriations rider to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II,"IN,CD,JJ,NNP,NNP,VBD,VBG,NNS,NN,IN,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,RB,VBG,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNS,NN,TO,VB,DT,NNPS,IN,IN,DT,NNP,VBD,VBN,NNP,NNP"
If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable,"IN,DT,NN,VBZ,JJ,IN,PRP,MD,VB,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,JJ,DT,NN,MD,VB,DT,NNS,NNS,IN,NN,CC,VB,DT,NN,IN,NN,VBG,DT,NN,VBG,PRP$,NNP,NNP,NNS,TO,VB,JJ,CC,JJ"
The Constitution does not expressly give the president such power,"DT,NNP,VBZ,RB,RB,VB,DT,NN,JJ,NN"
However the president does have a duty not to violate the Constitution,"RB,DT,NN,VBZ,VB,DT,NN,RB,TO,VB,DT,NNP"
The question is whether his only means of defense is the veto,"DT,NN,VBZ,IN,PRP$,JJ,NNS,IN,NN,VBZ,DT,NN"
Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the lineitem veto,"NN,IN,NNS,NNS,WDT,VBP,IN,DT,NN,NNS,CC,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,MD,VB,JJ,IN,DT,JJ,NN"
As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending the lineitem veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives,"IN,VBN,IN,DT,NN,IN,VBG,JJ,NN,DT,JJ,NN,VBZ,VBN,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,TO,VB,RB,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NN,NN,WDT,VBP,JJ,RB,IN,PRP,VBP,IN,PRP$,NN,NNS"
The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability,"DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NNS,NN,MD,VB,DT,NN,IN,RB,RBR,VBN,NN"
One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president by exerting a power of excision to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers,"CD,MD,VB,IN,PRP,VBZ,RB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,IN,DT,IN,DT,NN,IN,VBG,DT,NN,IN,NN,TO,VB,JJ,NNS,IN,NN,WDT,VBP,DT,NN,IN,NNS"
There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills,"EX,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,CD,NNS,NNS"
If Congress does nothing President Bush will have won,"IN,NNP,VBZ,NN,NNP,NNP,MD,VB,VBN"
If Congress takes the dispute to the Supreme Court LRB assuming it can establish standing to sue RRB President Bush might win,"IN,NNP,VBZ,DT,NN,TO,DT,NNP,NNP,RBR,VBG,PRP,MD,VB,NN,TO,VB,RBR,NNP,NNP,MD,VB"
In that case he might receive an opinion from the court that is a vindication of the president's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the framers thought should be entrusted to the executive,"IN,DT,NN,PRP,MD,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,WDT,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,TO,VB,DT,NNS,CC,VB,DT,NNS,DT,NNS,VBD,MD,VB,VBN,TO,DT,NN"
If President Bush loses at the court it might be disappointing as Morrison v Olson was for the Reagan administration,"IN,NNP,NNP,VBZ,IN,DT,NN,PRP,MD,VB,JJ,IN,NNP,CC,NNP,VBD,IN,DT,NNP,NN"
But the presidency would be no worse off than it is now,"CC,DT,NN,MD,VB,RB,JJR,IN,IN,PRP,VBZ,RB"
Moreover the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice,"RB,DT,NN,MD,VB,VBN,DT,JJ,NNS,NN,IN,WRB,DT,NN,IN,NNS,VBZ,IN,NN"
As it stands now Congress presumes after the Reagan administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down,"IN,PRP,VBZ,RB,NNP,VBZ,IN,DT,NNP,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,MD,VB,JJ,NNS,IN,NNS,NNS,VBG,IN"
President Bush should set things straight,"NNP,NNP,MD,VB,NNS,RB"
If he does not he will help realize Madison's fear in The Federalist No 48 of a legislature everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex,"IN,PRP,VBZ,RB,PRP,MD,VB,VB,NNP,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NN,CD,IN,DT,NN,RB,VBG,DT,NN,IN,PRP$,NN,CC,VBG,DT,NNS,IN,PRP$,JJ,NN"

Despite one of the most devastating droughts on record net cash income in the Farm Belt rose to a new high of 599 billion last year,"IN,CD,IN,DT,RBS,JJ,NNS,IN,NN,JJ,NN,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,VBD,TO,DT,JJ,NN,IN,CD,CD,JJ,NN"
The previous record was 577 billion in 1987 according to the Agriculture Department,"DT,JJ,NN,VBD,CD,CD,IN,CD,VBG,TO,DT,NNP,NNP"
Net cash income  the amount left in farmers' pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income  increased in 33 states in 1988 as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices the department's Economic Research Service reported yesterday,"JJ,NN,NN,CC,DT,NN,VBN,IN,NNS,NNS,IN,VBG,NNS,IN,JJ,NN,NN,CC,VBD,IN,CD,NNS,IN,CD,IN,DT,NN,VBD,IN,NN,NNS,CC,VBD,RP,NN,NNS,DT,NN,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBD,NN"
Most of those states set farm income records,"JJS,IN,DT,NNS,VBP,NN,NN,NNS"
The worst crop damage occurred in the Midwestern Corn Belt and the northern Great Plains,"DT,JJS,NN,NN,VBD,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,CC,DT,JJ,NNP,NNPS"
What saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had mortgaged to the government under pricesupport loan programs,"WP,VBD,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NN,VBD,DT,NN,TO,VB,JJ,NNS,IN,NN,CC,JJ,NNS,IN,PRP,VBD,VBN,TO,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NN,NNS"
With prices soaring they were able to sell the reclaimed commodities at considerable profit the agency's 240page report said,"IN,NNS,VBG,PRP,VBD,JJ,TO,VB,DT,VBN,NNS,IN,JJ,NN,DT,NN,JJ,NN,VBD"
In less parched areas meanwhile farmers who had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices,"IN,JJR,VBN,NNS,RB,NNS,WP,VBD,JJ,CC,DT,NN,IN,NN,VBD,RB,IN,DT,JJR,NNS"
To the surprise of some analysts net cash income rose in some of the hardesthit states including Indiana Illinois Nebraska and the Dakotas,"TO,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNS,JJ,NN,NN,VBD,IN,DT,IN,DT,JJ,NNS,VBG,NNP,NNP,NNP,CC,DT,NNPS"
Analysts attributed the increases partly to the 4 billion disasterassistance package enacted by Congress,"NNS,VBD,DT,NNS,RB,TO,DT,CD,CD,JJ,NN,VBN,IN,NNP"
Last year's record net cash income confirms the farm sector's rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s,"JJ,NN,NN,NN,NN,NN,VBZ,DT,NN,NN,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,JJ,CD"
It also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the 1985 farm program next year,"PRP,RB,VBZ,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,NNS,CC,JJ,NNS,TO,VB,DT,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,CD,NN,NN,IN,NN"
Commodity prices have been rising in recent years with the farm price index hitting record peaks earlier this year as the government curtailed production with landidling programs to reduce pricedepressing surpluses,"NN,NNS,VBP,VBN,VBG,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NN,NN,NN,VBG,NN,NNS,JJR,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBD,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,TO,VB,JJ,NNS"
At the same time export demand for US wheat corn and other commodities strengthened said Keith Collins a department analyst,"IN,DT,JJ,NN,NN,NN,IN,NNP,NN,NN,CC,JJ,NNS,VBD,VBD,NNP,NNP,DT,NN,NN"
Farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices as the nation's cattle inventory dropped close to a 30year low,"NNS,RB,VBD,IN,JJ,NN,NNS,IN,DT,NN,NNS,NN,VBD,RB,TO,DT,JJ,NN"
All of these forces came together in 1988 to benefit agriculture Mr Collins said,"DT,IN,DT,NNS,VBD,RB,IN,CD,TO,VB,NN,NNP,NNP,VBD"
California led the nation with 65 billion in net cash income last year followed by Texas 39 billion; Iowa 34 billion; Florida 31 billion; and Minnesota 27 billion,"NNP,VBD,DT,NN,IN,CD,CD,IN,JJ,NN,NN,JJ,NN,VBN,IN,NNP,CD,CD,NNP,CD,CD,NNP,CD,CD,CC,NNP,CD,CD"
Iowa and Minnesota were among the few major farm states to log a decline in net cash income,"NNP,CC,NNP,VBD,IN,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,NNS,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NN,NN"
Despite federal disaster relief the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an estimated 10000 to 15000 farmers according to the department,"IN,JJ,NN,NN,DT,NN,IN,CD,VBD,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,IN,DT,VBN,CD,TO,CD,NNS,VBG,TO,DT,NN"
Many lost their farms,"JJ,VBD,PRP$,NNS"
Department economists don't expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was,"NN,NNS,VBP,VB,CD,TO,VB,RB,JJ,DT,NN,IN,CD,VBD"
Indeed net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline,"RB,JJ,NN,NN,VBZ,JJ,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,NN,NNS,VBP,CC,NN,NNS,TO,NNS,VBP"
At the same time an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn soybeans and other commodities causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the Soviets,"IN,DT,JJ,NN,DT,NN,IN,NN,IN,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,VBN,NN,IN,NN,NNS,CC,JJ,NNS,VBG,DT,NN,IN,NNS,WDT,VBZ,VBN,RB,RB,VBN,IN,JJ,NN,NN,IN,DT,NNPS"

The demise of the 238000circulation Herald once the nation's largest afternoon newspaper with circulation exceeding 700000 turns the country's secondlargest city into a onenewspaper town at least in some senses,"DT,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NNP,RB,DT,NN,JJS,NN,NN,IN,NN,VBG,CD,VBZ,DT,NN,JJ,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,JJS,IN,DT,NNS"

To that end American Express has been signing up gasoline companies car repair shops tire companies and car dealers to accept the card,"TO,DT,NN,NNP,NNP,VBZ,VBN,VBG,RP,NN,NNS,NN,NN,NNS,NN,NNS,CC,NN,NNS,TO,VB,DT,NN"
Many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the American Express card but few card holders realize this Mr Riese says,"JJ,NN,NNS,RB,VBP,NN,NNS,VB,NN,CC,DT,IN,PRP$,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,NN,CC,JJ,NN,NNS,VBP,DT,NNP,NNP,VBZ"
Until now however buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through General Motors Acceptance Corp couldn't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with truthinlending and state disclosure laws over finance rates says a spokesman for the GM finance arm,"IN,RB,RB,NNS,WP,VBD,TO,VB,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,IN,NNP,NNPS,NNP,NNP,MD,VB,PRP$,NN,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,IN,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,NN,CC,NN,NN,NNS,IN,NN,NNS,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NN,NN"
But GMAC approved the Buick program he says because the American Express green card requires payment in full upon billing and so doesn't carry any finance rates,"CC,NNP,VBD,DT,NNP,NN,PRP,VBZ,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,JJ,NN,VBZ,NN,IN,JJ,IN,NN,CC,RB,VBZ,VB,DT,NN,NNS"
Mr Riese says American Express considers GM and Buick very sophisticated directmail marketers so by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our directmail capability,"NNP,NNP,VBZ,NNP,NNP,VBZ,NNP,CC,NNP,RB,JJ,JJ,NNS,IN,IN,VBG,NNS,IN,PRP,PRP,VBP,VBN,TO,VB,PRP$,JJ,NN"
In addition Buick is a relatively respected nameplate among American Express card holders says an American Express spokeswoman,"IN,NN,NNP,VBZ,DT,RB,VBN,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NN,NNS,VBZ,DT,NNP,NNP,NN"
When the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases Buick came in fourth among US cars and in the top 10 of all cars the spokeswoman says,"WRB,DT,NN,VBD,NNS,IN,DT,NN,WDT,NNS,PRP,MD,VB,TO,VB,NN,IN,IN,JJ,JJ,NNS,NNP,VBD,RP,JJ,IN,NNP,NNS,CC,IN,DT,NN,CD,IN,DT,NNS,DT,NN,VBZ"
American Express has more than 24 million card holders in the US and over half have the green card,"NNP,NNP,VBZ,JJR,IN,CD,CD,NN,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,CC,IN,DT,VBP,DT,JJ,NN"
GMAC screened the cardmember list for holders more than 30 years old with household incomes over 45000 who hadn't missed any payments the Buick spokeswoman says,"NNP,VBD,DT,NN,NN,IN,NNS,JJR,IN,CD,NNS,JJ,IN,NN,NNS,IN,CD,WP,VBD,VBN,DT,NNS,DT,NNP,NN,VBZ"
Some 38 million of the five million who will get letters were preapproved for credit with GMAC,"DT,CD,CD,IN,DT,CD,CD,WP,MD,VB,NNS,VBD,VBN,IN,NN,IN,NNP"
These 38 million people also are eligible to get one percentage point off GMAC's advertised finance rates which start at 69 for twoyear loan contracts,"DT,CD,CD,NNS,RB,VBP,JJ,TO,VB,CD,NN,NN,IN,NNP,VBN,NN,NNS,WDT,VBP,IN,CD,IN,JJ,NN,NNS"
A spokesman for Visa International's US subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards but doesn't have plans for a tiein similar to the American ExpressBuick link,"DT,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,NN,VBZ,PRP$,NN,VBZ,VBG,NNS,TO,VB,NN,IN,PRP$,NNS,CC,VBZ,VB,NNS,IN,DT,NN,JJ,TO,DT,NNP,NNP,NN"
Three divisions at American Express are working with Buick on the promotion the establishment services division which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card; the travel division; and the merchandise sales division,"CD,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP,VBP,VBG,IN,NNP,IN,DT,NN,DT,NN,NNS,NN,WDT,VBZ,JJ,IN,DT,NNS,CC,NNS,WDT,VBP,DT,NN,DT,NN,NN,CC,DT,NN,NNS,NN"

This isn't Buick's first travelrelated promotion,"DT,VBZ,NNP,JJ,JJ,NN"
A few years ago the company offered two roundtrip tickets on Trans World Airlines to buyers of its Riviera luxury car,"DT,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NN,VBD,CD,JJ,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP,NNPS,TO,NNS,IN,PRP$,NNP,NN,NN"
The promotion helped Riviera sales exceed the division's forecast by more than 10 Buick said at the time,"DT,NN,VBD,NNP,NNS,VB,DT,NN,NN,IN,JJR,IN,CD,NNP,VBD,IN,DT,NN"
The United Kingdom High Court declared illegal a variety of interestrate swap transactions and options deals between a London borough council and commercial banks,"DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBD,JJ,DT,NN,IN,NN,NN,NNS,CC,NNS,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,NN,NN,CC,JJ,NNS"
The ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions,"DT,NN,MD,VB,TO,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NN,NNS,DT,NNP,NNP,IN,NNP,CC,NNP,VBD,RP,IN,VBG,RB,IN,NN,NNS"
As many as 70 UK and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities,"RB,JJ,IN,CD,NNP,CC,JJ,NNS,VBP,TO,VB,JJ,CD,CD,NNS,MD,DT,NN,VB,VBN,CC,VB,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS"
An appeal is expected,"DT,NN,VBZ,VBN"
In response to the ruling gilt futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session,"IN,NN,TO,DT,NN,JJ,NNS,RB,VBD,JJR,IN,DT,NN,NN,IN,VBG,JJ,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN"
Gilts or British government bonds which also fell sharply initially retraced some of the losses to end about 3/8 point lower,"NNS,CC,JJ,NN,NNS,WDT,RB,VBD,RB,RB,VBD,DT,IN,DT,NNS,TO,VB,IN,CD,NN,JJR"
The council which is alleged to have engaged in over 600 deals valued at over CD 6 billion LRB 95 billion RRB lost millions of pounds from soured swap deals,"DT,NN,WDT,VBZ,VBN,TO,VB,VBN,IN,IN,CD,NNS,VBN,IN,IN,CD,CD,CD,RBR,CD,CD,RBR,VBD,NNS,IN,NNS,IN,JJ,NN,NNS"
At one point Hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10 of the sterling market in interestrate swap dealings,"IN,CD,NN,NNP,VBZ,VBN,TO,VB,VBN,IN,RB,JJ,IN,CD,IN,DT,NN,NN,IN,NN,NN,NNS"
When two parties engage in an interestrate swap they are betting against each other on future rates,"WRB,CD,NNS,VBP,IN,DT,NN,NN,PRP,VBP,VBG,IN,DT,JJ,IN,JJ,NNS"
Thus an institution obligated to make fixedrate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floatingrate payments,"RB,DT,NN,VBD,TO,VB,JJ,NN,NNS,IN,NN,NNS,DT,NNS,IN,DT,VBG,JJ,NNS"
In most of the British transactions the municipalities agreed to make floatingrate payments to banks which would make fixedrate payments,"IN,JJS,IN,DT,JJ,NNS,DT,NNS,VBD,TO,VB,JJ,NNS,TO,NNS,WDT,MD,VB,JJ,NNS"
As interest rates rose municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them,"IN,NN,NNS,VBD,NNS,VBD,DT,NNS,JJR,IN,DT,NNS,VBD,VBG,PRP"
The court hearing began in early October at the request of Anthony Hazell district auditor for Hammersmith who argued that local councils aren't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such capitalmarkets activities,"DT,NN,NN,VBD,IN,JJ,NNP,IN,DT,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NN,NN,IN,NNP,WP,VBD,IN,JJ,NNS,VBP,VBN,IN,JJ,NN,TO,VB,IN,JJ,JJ,NNS"
The council backed the audit commission's stand that the swap transactions are illegal,"DT,NN,VBD,DT,NN,NN,NN,IN,DT,NN,NNS,VBP,JJ"
Although the Hammersmith and Fulham council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such capitalmarkets transactions the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by 77 other local councils,"IN,DT,NNP,CC,NNP,NN,VBD,IN,RB,DT,RBS,JJ,JJ,NN,VBG,IN,JJ,JJ,NNS,DT,NN,NN,MD,VB,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,CD,JJ,JJ,NNS"
While this court ruling was only on Hammersmith it will obviously be very persuasive in other cases of a similar nature a solicitor representing one of the banks said,"IN,DT,NN,NN,VBD,RB,IN,NNP,PRP,MD,RB,VB,RB,JJ,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NN,DT,NN,VBG,CD,IN,DT,NNS,VBD"
Already 10 local councils have refused to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings,"RB,CD,JJ,NNS,VBP,VBN,TO,VB,NNS,CC,NNS,TO,NNS,VBN,IN,JJ,NNS,NNS"
Other financial institutions involved include Barclays Bank PLC Midland Bank PLC Security Pacific Corp Chemical Banking Corp's Chemical Bank Citicorp's Citibank and Mitsubishi Finance International,"JJ,JJ,NNS,VBN,VBP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP,NNP"
If the banks exhaust all avenues of appeal it is possible that they would seek to have the illegality ruling work both ways some market sources said,"IN,DT,NNS,VBP,DT,NNS,IN,NN,PRP,VBZ,JJ,IN,PRP,MD,VB,TO,VB,DT,NN,NN,VB,DT,NNS,DT,NN,NNS,VBD"
Banks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in instances where the banks made net payments to councils,"NNS,MD,VB,TO,VB,NNS,TO,JJ,NNS,IN,NNS,WRB,DT,NNS,VBD,JJ,NNS,TO,NNS"
Officials from the various banks involved are expected to meet during the next few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities that could be questionable,"NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NNS,VBN,VBP,VBN,TO,VB,IN,DT,JJ,JJ,NNS,TO,VB,JJ,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,WDT,MD,VB,JJ"
The banks have 28 days to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly,"DT,NNS,VBP,CD,NNS,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,CC,VBP,VBN,TO,VB,RB,RB"

Since October's minicrash Wall Street has been shaken by an explosion of resentment against program trading the computerdriven lightningfast trades of huge baskets of stocks and futures that can send stock prices reeling in minutes,"IN,NNP,NN,NNP,NNP,VBZ,VBN,VBN,IN,DT,NN,IN,NN,IN,NN,NN,DT,JJ,JJ,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,NNS,CC,NNS,WDT,MD,VB,NN,NNS,VBG,IN,NNS"
But the heated fight over program trading is about much more than a volatile stock market,"CC,DT,VBN,NN,IN,NN,NN,VBZ,IN,RB,JJR,IN,DT,JJ,NN,NN"
The real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards,"DT,JJ,NN,VBZ,IN,WP,MD,VB,DT,NN,CC,VB,PRP$,JJ,NNS"
Program trading itself according to many academics who have studied it is merely caught in the middle of this battle unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace,"NN,NN,PRP,VBG,TO,JJ,NNS,WP,VBP,VBN,PRP,VBZ,RB,VBN,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,RB,VBN,IN,DT,NN,VBG,NN,IN,DT,NN"
The evidence indicates that program trading didn't in fact cause the market's sharp fall on Oct 13 though it may have exacerbated it,"DT,NN,VBZ,IN,NN,NN,VBD,IN,NN,VB,DT,NN,JJ,NN,IN,NNP,CD,IN,PRP,MD,VB,VBN,PRP"
On one side of this power struggle stand the forces in ascendency on Wall Street  the New Guard  consisting of hightech computer wizards at the major brokerage firms their pension fund clients with immense pools of money and the traders at the fastgrowing Chicago futures exchanges,"IN,CD,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,VBP,DT,NNS,IN,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,DT,NNP,NNP,CC,VBG,IN,JJ,NN,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NN,NNS,PRP$,NN,NN,NNS,IN,NN,NNS,IN,NN,CC,DT,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NNP,NNS,NNS"

Defending their ramparts are Wall Street's Old Guard  the traditional stockpicking money managers tens of thousands of stock brokers the New York Stock Exchange's listed companies and the clannish floor traders known as specialists who make markets in their stocks,"VBG,PRP$,NNS,VBP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,CC,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,NNS,NNS,IN,NNS,IN,NN,NNS,DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBN,NNS,CC,DT,JJ,NN,NNS,VBN,IN,NNS,WP,VBP,NNS,IN,PRP$,NNS"

Short of a total ban some antiprogrammers have proposed several middleground reforms which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors don't,"JJ,IN,DT,NN,NN,DT,NNS,VBP,VBN,JJ,JJ,NNS,WDT,PRP,VBP,MD,VB,RP,JJ,NNS,NN,NNS,RB,VBP,IN,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,VBP"
One such proposal regarding stockindex futures is an increase in the margin requirement  or the goodfaith payment of cash needed to trade them  to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks,"CD,JJ,NN,VBG,NN,NNS,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,CC,CC,DT,NN,NN,IN,NN,VBN,TO,VB,PRP,CC,TO,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,IN,NNS"
Currently margins on stock futures purchases are much lower  roughly 7 compared with 50 for stocks  making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative,"RB,NNS,IN,NN,NNS,NNS,VBP,RB,JJR,CC,RB,CD,VBN,IN,CD,IN,NNS,CC,VBG,DT,NNS,NN,RB,JJR,CC,RB,RBR,JJ"
Program trading critics also want the Federal Reserve Board rather than the futures industry to set such margins,"NN,NN,NNS,RB,VBP,DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,RB,IN,DT,NNS,NN,TO,VB,JJ,NNS"
Futures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active,"NNS,NNS,VBP,IN,JJ,NNS,VBP,VB,PRP$,NNS,JJ"
Higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell they say,"JJR,NNS,MD,VB,RB,NNS,IN,JJR,NNS,WP,VBP,JJR,NNS,VB,CC,VB,PRP,VBP"
Another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an uptick rule a reform instituted after the Great Crash of 1929 that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices namely short sellers,"DT,VBN,NN,VBZ,TO,VB,NN,NNS,VB,TO,DT,NN,NN,DT,NN,VBN,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,IN,CD,WDT,VBZ,IN,NNS,VBG,RB,VBN,RB,IN,DT,VBG,TO,VB,IN,JJR,NNS,RB,JJ,NNS"
The Big Board's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price,"DT,NNP,NNP,NN,NN,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,WRB,DT,NN,VBZ,VBG,IN,NN"
But in 1986 program traders received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations to make it easier to link the stock and futures markets,"CC,IN,CD,NN,NNS,VBD,WP,VBD,TO,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,TO,VB,PRP,JJR,TO,VB,DT,NN,CC,NNS,NNS"
A reinstatement of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably,"DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,IN,NN,NNS,MD,VB,PRP$,NN,RB"
Program traders argue that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the pricing efficiency of the futures and stock markets,"NN,NNS,VBP,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,MD,VB,DT,NN,NN,IN,DT,NNS,CC,NN,NNS"

Index arbitrage is a common form of program trading,"NN,NN,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NN,NN"
As usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept Two separate markets in different locations trading basically the same widgets can't trade them for long at prices that are widely different,"IN,RB,VBN,PRP,VBZ,NN,IN,DT,RB,JJ,NN,CD,JJ,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,VBG,RB,DT,JJ,NNS,MD,VB,PRP,IN,RB,IN,NNS,WDT,VBP,RB,JJ"
In index arbitrage the widget is the S&P 500 and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in Chicago and the stock markets largely in New York,"IN,NN,NN,DT,NN,VBZ,DT,NNP,CD,CC,PRP$,NN,VBZ,RB,VBN,IN,DT,NNS,NN,IN,NNP,CC,DT,NN,NNS,RB,IN,NNP,NNP"
To profit from an indexarbitrage opportunity someone who owns the S&P 500 widget in New York must sell it and replace it with a cheaper S&P 500 widget in Chicago,"TO,VB,IN,DT,JJ,NN,NN,WP,VBZ,DT,NNP,CD,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,MD,VB,PRP,CC,VB,PRP,IN,DT,JJR,NNP,CD,NN,IN,NNP"
If the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the S&P 500 index he is likely to remain fully invested at all times,"IN,DT,NN,NN,VBG,DT,NN,VBZ,VBG,VBN,IN,PRP$,NNS,TO,VB,CC,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNP,CD,NN,PRP,VBZ,JJ,TO,VB,RB,VBN,IN,DT,NNS"
LRB Few if any indexfund managers will risk leveraging performance by owning more than 100 exposure to stocks and equally few will want to own less than a 100 position should stocks rise RRB,"RBR,JJ,IN,DT,JJ,NNS,MD,VB,VBG,NN,IN,VBG,JJR,IN,CD,NN,TO,NNS,CC,RB,JJ,MD,VB,TO,VB,JJR,IN,DT,CD,NN,MD,NNS,VB,RBR"
By constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget indexarbitrage traders hope to add between 1 and 3 to the annual return of the S&P 500,"IN,RB,VBG,TO,VB,DT,JJS,NN,JJ,NNS,VBP,TO,VB,IN,CD,CC,CD,TO,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NNP,CD"
That represents a very thin excess return certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim to seek as their performance objective,"DT,VBZ,DT,RB,JJ,JJ,NN,RB,RB,JJR,IN,WP,RBS,JJ,NN,NNS,VBP,TO,VB,IN,PRP$,NN,NN"
The fact that a vast majority of fundamentalist money managers fail to beat the S&P 500 may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue,"DT,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,JJ,NN,NNS,VBP,TO,VB,DT,NNP,CD,MD,VB,TO,DT,NN,VBG,DT,NN"
As more managers pursue the indexarbitrage strategy these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and eventually eliminated,"IN,JJR,NNS,VBP,DT,JJ,NN,DT,JJ,NNS,IN,NNS,MD,VB,VBN,CC,RB,VBN"
The current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the S&P 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market,"DT,JJ,NNS,VBP,IN,DT,NN,IN,VBG,DT,NN,CC,NN,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NNS,WDT,VBP,RP,DT,NNP,CD,VBZ,RBR,JJ,IN,VBG,IN,DT,NNS,NN"
The New York Stock Exchange's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares,"DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NN,TO,VB,DT,JJ,NN,NN,VBZ,NN,IN,NNS,NNS,TO,VB,JJ,CC,JJ,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,NNS"
So if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget how did program trading evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many observers?,"RB,IN,NN,NN,VBZ,RB,VBG,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,CD,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NN,WRB,VBD,NN,NN,VB,IN,DT,JJ,NN,WDT,VBZ,VBG,DT,NNS,IN,RB,JJ,NNS"
All arguments against program trading even those pressed without fact conclude with three expected results after reforms are implemented 1 RRB reduced volatility 2 RRB a longterm investment focus and 3 RRB a level playing field for the small investor,"DT,NNS,IN,NN,NN,RB,DT,VBN,IN,NN,VBP,IN,CD,VBN,NNS,IN,NNS,VBP,VBN,LS,RBR,VBN,NN,LS,RBR,DT,JJ,NN,NN,CC,LS,RBR,DT,NN,NN,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN"

Reducing volatility,"VBG,NN"
An indexarbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in New York and Chicago to cover all transaction costs,"DT,JJ,NN,VBZ,RB,VBN,IN,EX,VBZ,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,TO,VB,DT,NN,NNS"
Arbitrage doesn't cause volatility; it responds to it,"NN,VBZ,VB,NN,PRP,VBZ,TO,PRP"
Think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for S&P 500 stocks  usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in Chicago,"VB,IN,WP,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,NNS,IN,DT,CD,NNS,IN,NNP,CD,NNS,CC,RB,PRP,VBZ,JJ,NNS,VBG,DT,NN,CC,NN,IN,NNP"
A large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his futures,"DT,JJ,NN,MD,RB,VB,DT,NNS,NN,TO,VB,WRB,PRP,VBZ,PRP$,NNS"
Arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from Chicago to New York while functioning as a buyer in Chicago,"NN,RB,VBZ,PRP$,NN,NN,IN,NNP,TO,NNP,NNP,IN,VBG,IN,DT,NN,IN,NNP"
The start of the whole process is the key  someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in widgets to make widget prices move,"DT,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,VBZ,DT,NN,CC,NN,MD,RB,VB,CC,VB,PRP$,NN,IN,NNS,TO,VB,NN,NNS,VB"
Why does this large hypothetical seller trade in Chicago instead of New York?,"WRB,VBZ,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,VB,IN,NNP,RB,IN,NNP,NNP"

In a competitive market this investor has many ways to execute his transactions and he will have more alternatives LRB both foreign and domestic RRB if his volume is profitable for an exchange to handle,"IN,DT,JJ,NN,DT,NN,VBZ,JJ,NNS,TO,VB,PRP$,NNS,CC,PRP,MD,VB,JJR,NNS,RBR,DT,JJ,CC,JJ,RBR,IN,PRP$,NN,VBZ,JJ,IN,DT,NN,TO,VB"
If not Chicago then in New York; if not the US then overseas,"IN,RB,NNP,RB,IN,NNP,NNP,IN,RB,DT,NNP,RB,RB"
Volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity,"NN,VBG,PRP$,NNS,VBZ,RB,IN,IN,NN,NN,CC,IN,PRP$,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN,CC,NN,TO,DT,NN,NN,IN,JJ,NN"
Eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising creating more volatility instead of less,"VB,NN,CC,NN,MD,VB,RB,IN,VBG,VBG,JJR,NN,RB,IN,JJR"

As a part of overall efforts to reduce spending Congress cut by 30 million the Bush administration's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 which began Oct 1,"IN,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,TO,VB,NN,NNP,VBD,IN,CD,CD,DT,NNP,NN,NN,IN,JJ,NN,IN,JJ,CD,WDT,VBD,NNP,CD"
To offset the reduction Congress approved a 20000 fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers acquisitions and certain other transactions,"TO,VB,DT,NN,NNP,VBD,DT,CD,NN,IN,NNS,CC,NNS,MD,VB,TO,VB,DT,NN,PRP,VBP,VBN,NNS,TO,JJ,NNS,IN,NNS,NNS,CC,JJ,JJ,NNS"

Currently the government charges nothing for such filings,"RB,DT,NN,VBZ,NN,IN,JJ,NNS"
Proponents of the funding arrangement predict that based on recent filing levels of more than 2000 a year the fees will yield at least 40 million this fiscal year or 10 million more than the budget cuts,"NNS,IN,DT,NN,NN,VBP,IN,VBN,IN,JJ,NN,NNS,IN,JJR,IN,CD,DT,NN,DT,NNS,MD,VB,IN,JJS,CD,CD,DT,JJ,NN,CC,CD,CD,JJR,IN,DT,NN,NNS"

The scientists said they created small changes in the crystallattice structures of the superconductors to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry to 600000 amps per square centimeter in a moderately strong magnetic field,"DT,NNS,VBD,PRP,VBD,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NNS,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,MD,VB,TO,CD,NNS,IN,JJ,NN,IN,DT,RB,JJ,JJ,NN"

The AT&T advance shows how one aspect of the currentcarrying problem can be overcome,"DT,NNP,NN,VBZ,WRB,CD,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,MD,VB,VBN"
But it won't lead to imminent use of new superconductors cautioned Robert B van Dover one of the AT&T researchers,"CC,PRP,MD,VB,TO,JJ,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,VBD,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,CD,IN,DT,NNP,NNS"
He added that the currentcarrying capacity of multicrystal samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of socalled weak links between crystals,"PRP,VBD,IN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,NNS,VBZ,RB,RB,IN,JJS,JJ,NNS,IN,IN,JJ,JJ,NNS,IN,NNS"
Such multicrystal materials will probably be needed for commercial applications,"JJ,JJ,NNS,MD,RB,VB,VBN,IN,JJ,NNS"
Mr van Dover said the AT&T team created the desired crystal changes by bombarding superconductor samples with neutrons a process that creates some radioactivity in the samples and may not be feasible for largescale commercial use,"NNP,NNP,NNP,VBD,DT,NNP,NN,VBD,DT,VBN,NN,NNS,IN,VBG,NN,NNS,IN,NNS,DT,NN,WDT,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNS,CC,MD,RB,VB,JJ,IN,JJ,JJ,NN"
Still scientists breathed a collective sigh of relief about the finding because it demonstrates how to overcome the flux pinning problem that earlier this year was widely publicized as undercutting new superconductors' potential,"RB,NNS,VBD,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,PRP,VBZ,WRB,TO,VB,DT,NN,NN,NN,IN,RBR,DT,NN,VBD,RB,VBN,IN,VBG,JJ,NNS,NN"
The problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals limiting their currentcarrying capacity,"DT,NN,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,JJ,JJ,NNS,IN,NN,NNS,VBG,PRP$,JJ,NN"
Mr van Dover said the crystal changes his team introduced apparently pins the magnetic fields in place preventing them from lowering currentcarrying capacity,"NNP,NNP,NNP,VBD,DT,NN,VBZ,PRP$,NN,VBD,RB,VBZ,DT,JJ,NNS,IN,NN,VBG,PRP,IN,VBG,JJ,NN"
Mr van Dover added that researchers are trying to determine precisely what crystal changes solved the problem,"NNP,NNP,NNP,VBD,IN,NNS,VBP,VBG,TO,VB,RB,WDT,NN,NNS,VBD,DT,NN"
Determining that may enable them to develop better ways to introduce the needed crystallattice patterns,"VBG,DT,MD,VB,PRP,TO,VB,JJR,NNS,TO,VB,DT,VBN,NN,NNS"

The biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper,"DT,JJS,NNS,RB,VB,DT,JJS,NNS,IN,PRP$,JJ,NN"

What worries creditrating concerns the most is that Wall Street firms are taking longterm risks with their own capital via leveraged buyout and junk bond financings,"WP,VBZ,NN,NNS,DT,JJS,VBZ,IN,NNP,NNP,NNS,VBP,VBG,JJ,NNS,IN,PRP$,JJ,NN,IN,JJ,NN,CC,NN,NN,NNS"
That's a departure from their traditional practice of transferring almost all financing risks to investors,"DT,DT,NN,IN,PRP$,JJ,NN,IN,VBG,RB,DT,VBG,NNS,TO,NNS"
Whereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly Wall Street's new penchant for leveraged buyouts and junk bonds is resulting in longterm lending commitments that stretch out for months or years,"IN,JJ,NNS,NNS,VBP,VBN,TO,VB,VBN,RB,NNP,NNP,JJ,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,CC,NN,NNS,VBZ,VBG,IN,JJ,VBG,NNS,WDT,VBP,RP,IN,NNS,CC,NNS"

Shearson also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buyout business,"NNP,RB,VBZ,VBN,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,NN"

Just as all plaintiffs are not alike it turns out that DES defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties,"RB,IN,DT,NNS,VBP,RB,RB,PRP,VBZ,RP,IN,NNP,NNS,VBD,DT,NNS,RB,CC,MD,VB,VBN,JJ,NNS"
The ultimate result came in Hymowitz v Lilly where the highest New York court expanded the marketshare approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove Mindy Hymowitz's mother didn't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages,"DT,JJ,NN,VBD,IN,NNP,CC,NNP,WRB,DT,JJS,NNP,NNP,NN,VBD,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,TO,VB,IN,NN,NNS,WDT,MD,VB,NNP,NNP,NN,VBD,VB,PRP$,NN,MD,RB,VB,PRP$,NN,IN,DT,NNS"
But as Duke University law professor William Van Alstyne notes by this reasoning a defendant could be held liable in New York for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in California,"CC,IN,NNP,NNP,NN,NN,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBZ,IN,DT,NN,DT,NN,MD,VB,VBN,JJ,IN,NNP,NNP,IN,DT,JJ,NN,RB,IN,PRP,VBD,PDT,PRP$,NNS,IN,NNP"
Despite the Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants,"IN,DT,NNP,NNP,NN,TO,VB,DT,NN,EX,VBP,JJ,JJ,NNS,IN,JJ,NN,CC,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NNS"
The big problem however is that there's no guarantee that this reasoning will be limited to DES or to drugs,"DT,JJ,NN,RB,VBZ,IN,EX,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,MD,VB,VBN,TO,NNP,CC,TO,NNS"
The problem here goes well beyond twisting legal doctrine,"DT,NN,RB,VBZ,RB,IN,VBG,JJ,NN"
The California Supreme Court last year reversed direction to make it much harder to win DES cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs,"DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,JJ,NN,VBD,NN,TO,VB,PRP,RB,JJR,TO,VB,NNP,NNS,IN,DT,NNS,VBD,WRB,PDT,DT,JJ,NN,VBZ,VBN,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NNS"
The court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs citing the huge hidden social costs,"DT,NN,VBD,JJ,NN,IN,NN,NNS,VBG,DT,JJ,VBN,JJ,NNS"
Public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs even though some risks perhaps serious ones might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering the unanimous court said,"JJ,NN,VBZ,DT,NN,CC,NN,IN,JJ,JJ,NNS,RB,IN,DT,NNS,RB,JJ,NNS,MD,VB,PRP$,NN,IN,NNS,MD,VB,NNS,CC,VB,NN,CC,NN,DT,JJ,NN,VBD"
The California justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining antimorningsickness drug Bendectin off the US market,"DT,NNP,NNS,VBD,IN,DT,NN,IN,NN,RB,VBD,DT,JJ,VBG,JJ,NN,NNP,IN,DT,NNP,NN"
This raises the key issue What to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs?,"DT,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN,WP,TO,VB,IN,NNS,WP,VBP,JJ,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS"
We now know that holding drug makers liable where there's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs won't be available to anyone,"PRP,RB,VBP,IN,VBG,NN,NNS,JJ,WRB,EX,DT,NN,IN,PRP,CC,NN,RB,VBD,IN,DT,NNS,RB,VBZ,DT,NNS,MD,VB,JJ,TO,NN"
As liability expert Peter Huber tells us after the Hymowitz case if any drug maker introduces an antimiscarriage drug it's time to sell that company's stock short,"IN,NN,NN,NNP,NNP,VBZ,PRP,IN,DT,NNP,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN,PRP,NN,TO,VB,DT,NN,NN,RB"
We also know that the tort system is a lousy way to compensate victims anyway; some win the legal lottery others get much less and contingencyfee lawyers take a big cut either way,"PRP,RB,VBP,IN,DT,NN,NN,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN,TO,VB,NNS,RB,DT,VBP,DT,JJ,NN,NNS,VBP,RB,JJR,CC,JJ,NNS,VBP,DT,JJ,NN,DT,NN"
DES daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts,"NNP,NNS,CC,JJ,NNS,IN,NNS,MD,VB,JJR,IN,IN,PRP$,NNS,VBD,VBN,IN,IN,DT,NNS"
Congress could create a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs,"NNP,MD,VB,DT,NN,NN,TO,VB,JJ,NNS,IN,VBG,DT,JJ,NN,IN,VBG,JJ,NNS"
But a 1986 law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children's vaccines with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation,"CC,DT,CD,NN,WDT,RB,VBD,NNS,IN,NNS,NNS,IN,DT,NN,NN,VBZ,RB,VBN,TO,VB,JJR,NN"
Everyone by now understands that Congress is utterly incapable of writing legislation to help deserving people without its becoming some billiondollar morass,"NN,IN,RB,VBZ,IN,NNP,VBZ,RB,JJ,IN,VBG,NN,TO,VB,JJ,NNS,IN,PRP$,VBG,DT,JJ,NN"
We have no doubt this is one reason judges in New York and justices on the Supreme Court are willing to trash the law in the DES cases,"PRP,VBP,DT,NN,DT,VBZ,CD,NN,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,VBP,JJ,TO,VB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NNS"
They must figure that justice has to get done by somebody but know it won't be done by Congress,"PRP,MD,VB,IN,NN,VBZ,TO,VB,VBN,IN,NN,CC,VB,PRP,MD,VB,VBN,IN,NNP"

The 32 stateowned DSM had eight million guilders of extraordinary charges in the latest quarter mainly to reflect onetime losses in connection with the disposal of some operations,"DT,CD,JJ,NNP,VBD,CD,CD,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,JJS,NN,RB,TO,VB,JJ,NNS,IN,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNS"
The charges were offset in part by a gain from the sale of the company's construction division,"DT,NNS,VBD,VBN,IN,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,NN"
Last year DSM had 71 million guilders of extraordinary charges for the restructuring program and other transactions,"JJ,NN,NNP,VBD,CD,CD,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NN,NN,CC,JJ,NNS"
The earnings growth also was fueled by the company's ability to cut net financing spending by half to around 15 million guilders,"DT,NNS,NN,RB,VBD,VBN,IN,DT,NN,NN,TO,VB,JJ,NN,NN,IN,NN,TO,IN,CD,CD,NNS"
Also substantially lower Dutch corporate tax rates helped the company keep its tax outlay flat relative to earnings growth the company added,"RB,RB,JJR,JJ,JJ,NN,NNS,VBD,DT,NN,VB,PRP$,NN,NN,JJ,JJ,TO,NNS,NN,DT,NN,VBD"

Rep John Dingell an important sponsor of President Bush's cleanair bill plans to unveil a surprise proposal that would break with the White House on a centerpiece issue acid rain,"NNP,NNP,NNP,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,JJ,NN,VBZ,TO,VB,DT,NN,NN,WDT,MD,VB,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,IN,DT,NN,NN,JJ,NN"
The Michigan Democrat's proposal which is expected today is described by government sources and lobbyists as significantly weaker than the Bush administration's plan to cut utility emissions that lead to acid rain,"DT,NNP,NNP,NN,WDT,VBZ,VBN,NN,VBZ,VBN,IN,NN,NNS,CC,NNS,RB,RB,JJR,IN,DT,NNP,NN,NN,TO,VB,NN,NNS,WDT,VBP,TO,JJ,NN"
The administration's plan could cost utilities mainly those that use coal up to 4 billion a year,"DT,NN,NN,MD,VB,NNS,RB,DT,WDT,VBP,NN,RB,TO,CD,CD,DT,NN"
The proposal comes as a surprise even to administration officials and temporarily throws into chaos the House's work on cleanair legislation,"DT,NN,VBZ,IN,DT,NN,RB,TO,NN,NNS,CC,RB,VBZ,IN,NN,DT,NNP,NN,IN,JJ,NN"
As chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee Mr Dingell has almost singlehanded control over cleanair legislation,"IN,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,VBZ,RB,JJ,NN,IN,JJ,NN"
People close to the utility industry said Mr Dingell's proposal appears to guarantee only an estimated sevenmillionton cut in annual sulfurdioxide emissions that lead to acid rain though additional cuts could be ordered later,"NNS,JJ,TO,DT,NN,NN,VBD,NNP,NNP,NN,VBZ,TO,VB,RB,DT,VBN,JJ,NN,IN,JJ,NN,NNS,WDT,VBP,TO,NN,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,MD,VB,VBN,JJ"

It also would junk an innovative marketbased system for trading emissions credits among polluters,"PRP,RB,MD,VB,DT,JJ,JJ,NN,IN,VBG,NNS,NNS,IN,NNS"
In addition it is believed to offer a costsharing mechanism that would help subsidize the cleanup costs for the dirtiest coalfired utilities in the country sparing their customers from exorbitant jumps in their electric bills,"IN,NN,PRP,VBZ,VBN,TO,VB,DT,JJ,NN,WDT,MD,VB,VB,DT,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,JJS,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NN,VBG,PRP$,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,PRP$,JJ,NNS"
The administration sticking to its vow of avoiding tax increases has staunchly opposed costsharing,"DT,NN,VBG,TO,PRP$,NN,IN,VBG,NN,NNS,VBZ,RB,VBN,NN"
Mr Dingell's staff was expected to present its acidrain alternative to other committee members apparently in an attempt to appease Midwestern lawmakers from highpolluting states who insist on costsharing,"NNP,NNP,NN,VBD,VBN,TO,VB,PRP$,NN,NN,TO,JJ,NN,NNS,RB,IN,DT,NN,TO,VB,JJ,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS,WP,VBP,IN,NN"
It isn't clear however whether support for the proposal will be broad enough to pose a serious challenge to the White House's acidrain plan,"PRP,VBZ,JJ,RB,IN,NN,IN,DT,NN,MD,VB,JJ,RB,TO,VB,DT,JJ,NN,TO,DT,NNP,NNP,NN,NN"
While the new proposal might appeal to the dirtiest utilities it might not win the support of utilities many in the West that already have added expensive cleanup equipment or burn cleanerburning fuels,"IN,DT,JJ,NN,MD,VB,TO,DT,JJS,NNS,PRP,MD,RB,VB,DT,NN,IN,NNS,JJ,IN,DT,NN,WDT,RB,VBP,VBN,JJ,NN,NN,CC,VBP,JJ,NNS"

According to reports carried by various news services the Brazilian government told its sugar producers that they won't be allowed to export sugar during the current 198990 season which began May 1 and the 199091 season so that it can be used to produce alcohol for automobile fuel,"VBG,TO,NNS,VBN,IN,JJ,NN,NNS,DT,JJ,NN,VBD,PRP$,NN,NNS,IN,PRP,MD,VB,VBN,TO,VB,NN,IN,DT,JJ,CD,NN,WDT,VBD,NNP,CD,CC,DT,CD,NN,IN,IN,PRP,MD,VB,VBN,TO,VB,NN,IN,NN,NN"
One analyst Arthur Stevenson of PrudentialBache Securities New York estimated that 65 or more of Brazil's newly made automobiles run on alcohol and can't use gasoline,"CD,NN,NNP,NNP,IN,NNP,NNPS,NNP,NNP,VBD,IN,CD,CC,JJR,IN,NNP,RB,VBN,NNS,VBP,IN,NN,CC,MD,VB,NN"
This is a demand that must be met regardless of the price of oil said Mr Stevenson,"DT,VBZ,DT,NN,WDT,MD,VB,VBN,RB,IN,DT,NN,IN,NN,VBD,NNP,NNP"
Brazil is the thirdlargest producer and the fifthlargest exporter of sugar in the world,"NNP,VBZ,DT,JJ,NN,CC,DT,JJ,NN,IN,NN,IN,DT,NN"
A shift to producing more alcohol and less sugar had been expected but the latest news if true indicates a more drastic shift than had been anticipated,"DT,NN,TO,VBG,JJR,NN,CC,JJR,NN,VBD,VBN,VBN,CC,DT,JJS,NN,IN,JJ,VBZ,DT,RBR,JJ,NN,IN,VBD,VBN,VBN"
During the current crop year Brazil was expected to produce 69 million tons of sugar a drop from 81 million tons in 198889,"IN,DT,JJ,NN,NN,NNP,VBD,VBN,TO,VB,CD,CD,NNS,IN,NN,DT,NN,IN,CD,CD,NNS,IN,CD"
Its 198990 exports were expected to total 645000 tons in contrast to shipments of 15 million tons in,"PRP$,CD,NNS,VBD,VBN,TO,VB,CD,NNS,IN,NN,TO,NNS,IN,CD,CD,NNS,IN"
It is these 645000 tons that are in question for this crop year explained Judith Ganes analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton New York,"PRP,VBZ,DT,CD,NNS,WDT,VBP,IN,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,VBD,NNP,NNP,NN,IN,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP"
Producers were granted the right earlier this year to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have begun to be issued yesterday,"NNS,VBD,VBN,DT,RB,RB,DT,NN,TO,VB,NN,CC,DT,NN,NNS,VBD,VBN,TO,VB,VBN,TO,VB,VBN,NN"
As a result Ms Ganes said it is believed that little or no sugar from the 198990 crop has been shipped yet even though the crop year is six months old,"IN,DT,NN,NNP,NNP,VBD,PRP,VBZ,VBN,IN,JJ,CC,DT,NN,IN,DT,CD,NN,VBZ,VBN,VBN,RB,RB,IN,DT,NN,NN,VBZ,CD,NNS,JJ"
More than a half of all sugar produced in Brazil goes for alcohol production according to Ms Ganes,"JJR,IN,DT,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBN,IN,NNP,VBZ,IN,NN,NN,VBG,TO,NNP,NNP"
Also there has been a switch in the past decade to planting of orange trees in areas that were previously used for cane and this change is being felt now she said,"RB,EX,VBZ,VBN,DT,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,TO,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,NNS,WDT,VBD,RB,VBN,IN,NN,CC,DT,NN,VBZ,VBG,VBN,RB,PRP,VBD"

Thomas Oxnard sugar analyst for PaineWebber in Hackensack NJ said I am highly skeptical that Brazil will curtail sugar exports particularly with the price of sugar at over 14 cents a pound,"NNP,NNP,NN,NN,IN,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,VBD,PRP,VBP,RB,JJ,IN,NNP,MD,VB,NN,NNS,RB,IN,DT,NN,IN,NN,IN,IN,CD,NNS,DT,NN"
Above all Mr Oxnard noted the situation is extremely confused,"IN,DT,NNP,NNP,VBD,DT,NN,VBZ,RB,VBN"
Professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the Brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation he said,"JJ,NN,NNS,RB,WP,VBP,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,NN,NN,VBP,VBN,JJ,TO,VB,DT,NNS,CC,VB,JJ,NN,TO,VB,DT,NN,PRP,VBD"
It's the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out such as the one saying exports will be suspended and no one can confirm it,"PRP,DT,NN,IN,JJ,NN,IN,WDT,DT,NN,MD,VB,VBN,RP,JJ,IN,DT,CD,VBG,NNS,MD,VB,VBN,CC,DT,NN,MD,VB,PRP"
Mr Oxnard observed that the situation in Brazil is also very complicated,"NNP,NNP,VBD,IN,DT,NN,IN,NNP,VBZ,RB,RB,VBN"
On the one hand Brazil started an ethanol program about 15 years ago to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program,"IN,DT,CD,NN,NNP,VBD,DT,NN,NN,IN,CD,NNS,IN,TO,VB,DT,JJ,NN,IN,PRP$,JJ,NN,IN,NNS,CC,VBZ,RB,VBN,TO,DT,NN"
It has to weigh on the other hand the relatively high price of sugar it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol Mr Oxnard said,"PRP,VBZ,TO,VB,IN,DT,JJ,NN,DT,RB,JJ,NN,IN,NN,PRP,MD,VB,IN,DT,NN,NN,IN,VBG,NNS,IN,TO,IN,TO,VB,NN,CC,NN,NNP,NNP,VBD"
Mexico which is normally a sugar exporter has had production problems in the past two years analysts said,"NNP,WDT,VBZ,RB,DT,NN,NN,VBZ,VBN,NN,NNS,IN,DT,JJ,CD,NNS,NNS,VBD"
Last year it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments they noted,"JJ,NN,PRP,VBD,TO,VB,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,TO,VB,NN,NNS,PRP,VBD"
This year it is expected to be a net importer and is said to be seeking to buy about 200000 tons of sugar to meet internal needs analysts said,"DT,NN,PRP,VBZ,VBN,TO,VB,DT,JJ,NN,CC,VBZ,VBN,TO,VB,VBG,TO,VB,IN,CD,NNS,IN,NN,TO,VB,JJ,NNS,NNS,VBD"

All this has cast a pall over Columbia Savings & Loan Association and its highrolling 43yearold chairman Thomas Spiegel who built the 127 billion Beverly Hills Calif thrift with highyield junk bonds,"PDT,DT,VBZ,VBN,DT,NN,IN,NNP,NNPS,CC,NNP,NNP,CC,PRP$,JJ,JJ,NN,NNP,NNP,WP,VBD,DT,CD,CD,NNP,NNP,NNP,NN,IN,JJ,NN,NNS"
Bears have targeted Columbia's stock because of the thrift's exposure to the shaky junk market,"NNS,VBP,VBN,NNP,NN,IN,IN,DT,NN,NN,TO,DT,JJ,NN,NN"
And some investors fault Mr Spiegel's life style; he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in Columbia's jet planes,"CC,DT,NNS,VBP,NNP,NNP,NN,NN,PRP,VBZ,NNS,IN,NNS,DT,NN,CC,VBZ,IN,IN,NNP,NN,NNS"
Columbia stock recently hit 4 1/8 after reaching 11 3/4 earlier this year on rumors that Mr Spiegel would take the thrift private,"NNP,NN,RB,VBD,CD,CD,IN,VBG,CD,CD,RBR,DT,NN,IN,NNS,IN,NNP,NNP,MD,VB,DT,NN,JJ"
Moreover junk professionals think Columbia's huge thirdquarter markdown of its junk portfolio to 44 billion wasn't enough meaning another markdown could be coming,"RB,NN,NNS,VBP,NNP,JJ,NN,NN,IN,PRP$,NN,NN,TO,CD,CD,VBD,RB,VBG,DT,NN,MD,VB,VBG"
But in recent days Columbia has edged up closing at 5 1/4 up 3/8 yesterday on revived speculation that the thrift might restructure,"CC,IN,JJ,NNS,NNP,VBZ,VBN,IN,VBG,IN,CD,CD,RB,CD,NN,IN,VBN,NN,IN,DT,NN,NN,VB"
Mr Spiegel's fans say Columbia's Southern California branches are highly salable and the thrift has 458 million of shareholders equity underlying its assets,"NNP,NNP,NNS,VBP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNS,VBP,RB,JJ,CC,DT,NN,VBZ,CD,CD,IN,NNS,NN,VBG,PRP$,NNS"
That's almost 10 of equity for each Columbia share including convertible preferred shares though more junk markdowns would reduce the cushion,"DT,RB,CD,IN,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NN,VBG,JJ,JJ,NNS,IN,JJR,NN,NNS,MD,VB,DT,NN"
Columbia has only about 10 million common shares in public hands,"NNP,VBZ,RB,IN,CD,CD,JJ,NNS,IN,JJ,NNS"
The Spiegel family has 25 of the common and 75 of the votes,"DT,NNP,NN,VBZ,CD,IN,DT,JJ,CC,CD,IN,DT,NNS"
Other big common holders are Carl Lindner's American Financial investor Irwin Jacobs and Pacific Financial Research though the latter cut its stake this summer,"JJ,JJ,JJ,NNS,VBP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NN,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP,NNP,IN,DT,NN,VBD,PRP$,NN,DT,NN"
While many problems would attend a restructuring of Columbia investors say Mr Spiegel is mulling such a plan to mitigate Columbia's junk problems,"IN,JJ,NNS,MD,VB,DT,NN,IN,NNP,NNS,VBP,NNP,NNP,VBZ,VBG,PDT,DT,NN,TO,VB,NNP,NN,NNS"
Indeed Columbia executives recently told reporters they were interested in creating a separate unit to hold Columbia's junk bonds and perhaps do merchant banking,"RB,NNP,NNS,RB,VBD,NNS,PRP,VBD,JJ,IN,VBG,DT,JJ,NN,TO,VB,NNP,NN,NNS,CC,RB,VB,JJ,NN"
Columbia won't comment on all the speculation,"NNP,MD,VB,IN,PDT,DT,NN"
But like other thrifts it's expected to seek regulators' consent to create a distinct junkbond entity,"CC,IN,JJ,NNS,PRP,VBN,TO,VB,NNS,NN,TO,VB,DT,JJ,NN,NN"
Plans to do this are due to be filed in a week or so,"NNS,TO,VB,DT,VBP,JJ,TO,VB,VBN,IN,DT,NN,CC,RB"
New rules force thrifts to write down their junk to market value then sell the bonds over five years,"JJ,NNS,VBP,NNS,TO,VB,RP,PRP$,NN,TO,NN,NN,RB,VB,DT,NNS,IN,CD,NNS"
That's why Columbia just wrote off 130 million of its junk and reserved 227 million for future junk losses,"DT,WRB,NNP,RB,VBD,RP,CD,CD,IN,PRP$,NN,CC,VBD,CD,CD,IN,JJ,NN,NNS"
But if Columbia could keep its junk bonds separate from the thrift till they mature  at full value unless the issuer goes bust or restructures  the junk portfolio might do all right,"CC,IN,NNP,MD,VB,PRP$,NN,NNS,JJ,IN,DT,NN,IN,PRP,VBP,CC,IN,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,NN,CC,VBZ,CC,DT,NN,NN,MD,VB,RB,RB"
Columbia a longtime Drexel client won't provide current data on its junk,"NNP,DT,NN,NNP,NN,MD,VB,JJ,NNS,IN,PRP$,NN"

These were Allied Stores Western Union Telegraph Gillett Holdings SCI Television and Texas Air though many other bonds in Columbia's portfolio also have lost value,"DT,VBD,NNP,NNPS,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP,NNP,IN,JJ,JJ,NNS,IN,NNP,NN,RB,VBP,VBN,NN"
Possibly offsetting that Columbia recently estimated it has unrealized gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than 70 million,"RB,VBG,DT,NNP,RB,VBD,PRP,VBZ,JJ,NNS,IN,RB,VBN,NN,NNS,IN,JJR,IN,CD,CD"
It also hopes for ultimate gains of as much as 300 million on equity investments in buyouts and restructurings,"PRP,RB,VBZ,IN,JJ,NNS,IN,RB,JJ,IN,CD,CD,IN,NN,NNS,IN,NNS,CC,NNS"
One trial balloon Mr Spiegel is said to have floated to investors Columbia might be broken up as Mellon Bank was split into a good bank and a bad bank,"CD,NN,NN,NNP,NNP,VBZ,VBN,TO,VB,VBN,TO,NNS,NNP,MD,VB,VBN,RP,IN,NNP,NNP,VBD,VBN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,CC,DT,JJ,NN"
But Columbia's good bank would be a regulated thrift while the bad bank would be a private investment company holding some of Columbia's junk bonds real estate and equity investments,"CC,NNP,JJ,NN,MD,VB,DT,VBN,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,MD,VB,DT,JJ,NN,NN,VBG,DT,IN,NNP,NN,NNS,JJ,NN,CC,NN,NNS"
Some think Columbia's thrift which now is seeking a new chief operating officer might be capitalized at say 300 million and shopped to a commercial bank that wants a California presence,"DT,VBP,NNP,NN,WDT,RB,VBZ,VBG,DT,JJ,NN,VBG,NN,MD,VB,VBN,IN,VB,CD,CD,CC,VBD,TO,DT,JJ,NN,WDT,VBZ,DT,NNP,NN"
The thrift surely could be sold for more than the value of its equity financial industry executives say,"DT,NN,RB,MD,VB,VBN,IN,JJR,IN,DT,NN,IN,PRP$,NN,JJ,NN,NNS,VBP"
Meanwhile the bad bank with the junk bonds  and some capital  might be spun off to Columbia shareholders including Mr Spiegel who might then have a new career investors say,"RB,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,NN,NNS,CC,CC,DT,NN,CC,MD,VB,VBN,RP,TO,NNP,NNS,VBG,NNP,NNP,WP,MD,RB,VB,DT,JJ,NN,NNS,VBP"
It isn't clear how much a restructuring would help Columbia stockholders,"PRP,VBZ,JJ,WRB,JJ,DT,NN,MD,VB,NNP,NNS"
But the concept is workable,"CC,DT,NN,VBZ,JJ"
You sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank says thrift specialist Lewis Ranieri of Ranieri Associates in New York,"PRP,VBP,DT,JJ,NN,IN,DT,JJ,NN,CC,VBP,DT,IN,DT,NNS,TO,VB,DT,JJ,NN,VBZ,NN,NN,NNP,NNP,IN,NNP,NNPS,IN,NNP,NNP"
Mr Spiegel's next career move is a subject of speculation on Wall Street,"NNP,NNP,JJ,NN,NN,VBZ,DT,NN,IN,NN,IN,NNP,NNP"

They aren't really a thrift says Jonathan Gray a Sanford C Bernstein analyst,"PRP,VBP,RB,DT,NN,VBZ,NNP,NNP,DT,NNP,NNP,NNP,NN"

It's a cosmetic move said Jonathan S Gelles of Wertheim Schroder & Co,"PRP,DT,JJ,NN,VBD,NNP,NNP,NNP,IN,NNP,NNP,CC,NNP"
According to Upjohn's estimates only 50 to 60 of the 1100 eligible employees will take advantage of the plan,"VBG,TO,NNP,NNS,RB,CD,TO,CD,IN,DT,CD,JJ,NNS,MD,VB,NN,IN,DT,NN"
Upjohn further estimated that about 50 of the employees who leave for early retirement may be replaced,"NNP,RB,VBD,IN,IN,CD,IN,DT,NNS,WP,VBP,IN,JJ,NN,MD,VB,VBN"
As a result Upjohn will likely trim only about 275 to 350 of its more than 21000 jobs worldwide,"IN,DT,NN,NNP,MD,RB,VB,RB,IN,CD,TO,CD,IN,PRP$,JJR,IN,CD,NNS,JJ"

But it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the Mississippi River on which flows much of the US corn that is shipped overseas,"CC,PRP,VBZ,RB,JJ,DT,NN,IN,IN,JJ,NN,NNS,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,IN,WDT,VBZ,JJ,IN,DT,NNP,NN,WDT,VBZ,VBN,RB"

At St Louis the water level of the Mississippi River is already 65 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 25 feet when the flow of the Missouri River is slowed an Army Corps spokesman said,"IN,NNP,NNP,DT,NN,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,VBZ,RB,CD,NNS,IN,JJ,CC,PRP,MD,VB,DT,JJ,CD,NNS,WRB,DT,NN,IN,DT,NNP,NNP,VBZ,VBN,DT,NNP,NNP,NN,VBD"

Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought,"NN,NNS,VBP,VBN,JJ,DT,NN,IN,DT,JJ,JJ,NNS,IN,DT,NN,VBZ,VBN,NNS,TO,VB,DT,NNS,VBN,IN,DT,CD,NN"

Farmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices,"NNS,VBP,IN,DT,JJS,NN,IN,JJ,NNS,TO,VB,IN,NN,NNS"
Because the drought reduced US stockpiles they have more than enough storage space for their new crop and that permits them to wait for prices to rise,"IN,DT,NN,VBD,NNP,NNS,PRP,VBP,JJR,IN,JJ,NN,NN,IN,PRP$,JJ,NN,CC,DT,VBZ,PRP,TO,VB,IN,NNS,TO,VB"
